          <p><b>INTRODUCTION AND PREFACE</b></p>

          <p>1. Why you should learn this.</p>

          <p>I am attempting to share some of my experiences and insights that I have learned over the past 25 years in order to give the reader a head start and help them not having to pay the tuition that I have had to in order to learn this information myself. (I define tuition as not only money you pay for formal education, but the money one looses while learning.) This is not to say that the reader will not have to also learn many lessons the hard way. You must learn through experience yourself. This is simply a help document for you.</p>

          <p>2. Why I did this.</p>

          <p>This document started by my desire to share with my daughters what I have learned about making money so that they could learn quickly how to do the same. In no way am I thinking that they will do it in the same way and with the same organizations that I have, but on their own, in their particular fields and interests. I also would like my partners and associates that I work with to better understand me and learn from this so that our organizations can become better and stronger.</p>

          <p>I also did this in order to share what I have learned, to express myself, and to help me organize my thoughts and learn. In a way I think of this as a curriculum to teach. </p>

          <p>3. Why this works.</p>

          <p>One thing that I have learned about myself is that I tend to listen. It is probably one of my best assets. I have had the opportunity to listen to a few very experienced and smart people that I respect and have been extremely successful. Very little of this information is my own, but borrowed.</p>

          <p>The particular sources of my information comes from organizations such as the Harvard Business School, University of California, and many extension classes. Individuals that have furnished much information have been: Ian Sharlit, Volney Stefflre, Mac Mc Keown, and many more that I will not list at this time. The organizations and businesses that I have started and/or taken part in growing are:</p>

          <p>Stefflre Associates, Inc.. Small Business Development Co., numerous service stations, The Park Mobile Home Park, Farmer's Corner Shopping Center, Janthina's Dinnerhouse, Gutenburgs Book Shop Cafe, Spartan Oil Co., Carr and Carr, Inc., Burke Oil Co., O.K. Services, Inc., Lewis Distributing, Swelle Oil Co., Southwest Petroleum, The SOCO Group, Barnicle Oil Co, Fast Fuels Inc., Neptune Oil Co. Barnicle -SoCo, Discover Nature, American Trading Inc., Russian Trading Inc., Estonian Trading Co. Island, Inc., Las Vegas Fast Fuels and HSM Petroleum Inc. </p>

          <p>Some of these have been very successful, and some I have paid very high tuition. It is encouraging to have learned that many very successful people in business made many mistakes before they made it big. The list goes on and on, but a few are Sam Walton, Walt Disney, etc.</p>

          <p>What I learned from each experience:</p>

          <p>SABe flexible, have a positive cash flow, and hold people accountable.</p>

          <p><b>II. How?</b></p>

          <p>1. Quotes That Have Stuck and Work</p>

          <p><b>“The Missionaries of the 90’s will be business persons.” </b>Chuck Fromm</p>

          <p>People must make a living and minister to others at the same time. </p>

          <p><b>"Imagination is more important that knowledge. " </b></p>

          <p>Albert Einstein</p>

          <p>One must learn where to find knowledge and information and use his or her brain to be creative in order to use the knowledge. To get many things accomplished it comes down to knowing where to get the information and who you know, not always what you know. Many times one should concentrate on general objectives and do not get tied down with the details. That is why we have learned that in general it is many times the fact that the A students in school ends up working for the C and B students years later, because the A students must tend to all the details in order to get their A's. This is not to say that the details are not important. Companies fail because details are not tented to. Details are extremely important, but in building a business organization one must delegate details because there is simply not enough hours in a day. </p>

          <p><b>"Simply Simplify"</b>, H. Scott McOwen</p>

          <p>In this complex world I have attempted to focus on keeping things that I run into as simple as possible. Do not go out of your way to make life hard on yourself, enough hard problems will find you. A very good solution is to follow what the Scripture tells you to do.</p>

          <p><b>"What is our Business? Who is our Customer? What does the customer Consider Value?" </b>Peter Drucker </p>

          <p>In business it is very easy to get side tracked and stop focusing on the customer. If you do not fill the customers needs and desires, you will not have a business. </p>

          <p><b>"The Market is there, you just have to find it. Do not fool yourself in thinking you can create it." </b>Marty Marshall </p>

          <p>It is very easy to think you can create a market for your "Great product or service". It just will not happen. You have to go find what the customer wants and then fill that need and desire.</p>

          <p><b>"Always Keep a Low Overhead and be Flexible enough to cut back to the bare bones in hard time."</b></p>

          <p><b>"Make very large profits in order to cover up your mistakes."</b></p>

          <p><b>"Make very large profits in order to save for a rainy day, because you will have them."</b></p>

          <p><b>"Most business failures are due to divorce and partner fights"</b></p>

          <p>Ian Sharlit</p>

          <p>Make profits when you can and get ready for tough times, because they always seem to come.</p>

          <p>"<b>If money can solve your problem, you do not really have a problem"</b></p>

          <p>Author Unknown</p>

          <p>This statement implies that your relationships and health is much more important than money. It is true that money cannot buy happiness. You need to keep your relationship with God and your family and close friends and associates in good order.</p>

          <p><b>"Only deal with good people."</b></p>

          <p>This is hard to judge, but if you know the person you are dealing with cheats someone else, it is more than likely that they will cheat you when they have a chance.</p>

          <p><b>"Life is like a mine field, you will run into the person you are dealing with sometime in the future so make sure you leave them on good terms now."</b></p>

          <p><b>"Only advertise if you have a way to keep score to see if it is working."</b></p>

          <p>Volney Stefflre</p>

          <p>You should treat every one you deal with, as you would like to be treated. It is a very small world and you might as well sleep as well as you can.</p>

          <p>2. Actions that have worked.</p>

          <p>INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY</p>

          <p>The intent of this paper is to help one start, buy and/or turn a business around. It is meant to create a hands on, interactive process that will allow someone to grasp the vision and tools it takes to get a venture off the ground with minimal experience. Entrepreneurs are both born and created. To accomplish entrepreneurial tasks it takes focus, hard work, and a long term commitment. An entrepreneur is someone who perceives an opportunity and creates an organization to pursue it. The entrepreneurial process involves all the functions, activities, and actions associated with perceiving opportunities and creating organizations to pursue them. In order to perceive the opportunities one must be observant, listen and concentrate on hearing. In order to create an organization that same person must understand people and their behavior. These gifts and learned skills must be put to play all at the same time therefore it is not an idle task, but when successful a very rewarding one.</p>

          <p>One of the first things one has to focus on is to deal with only very upstanding people with impeccable character, not only as partners and employees, but as best one can everyone they come in contact with. This will be impossible as the organization grows and encounters many different people and organizations, but it is a goal to attempt. Besides needing to be of good character in order to sleep well at night, the reason one should only deal with people of great character is a practical one. We live in a very small world and what encounters that occur today will stay with them their entire career. An employee or partner that cheats a customer will cheat an owner and will become very quickly addicted to the cheating and will most likely not be able to stop. Also, it has been found that most small organizations fail because of a break in a relationship. If it is a divorce, death, or break up of a partnership, the main reason for organization failure is due to a failure in a relationship. In comparison capital is not hard to come by when one compares having a good relationship. That is why one should be very careful when picking partners, not only for marriage, but for any organization. In other words only deal with good people of impeccable character and deal with the best qualified you can find. </p>

          <p>This paper will not spend much time on the legal, insurance and other organizational functions that will most likely be contracted out with outside counsel. When selecting an attorney, insurance broker, real estate broker, pension administrator, etc. get the best and let them do their work. Don’t you attempt to do that type of work yourself and save a few dollars, because it is not worth it. You must focus on your business and accomplish what your specific task is. Put blinders on, as they put on racehorses, and focus on your mission statement, do not attempt to practice law, insurance etc. There are countless sociological and physiological ingredients that will contribute to the success or failure of your venture. I do encourage you to learn as much as you can. </p>

          <p>The crucial ingredients for entrepreneurial success are a superb entrepreneur with a first-rate management team and an excellent market opportunity. It is very difficult to get very much accomplished on your own so you must put together a first-rate management team that can work together and that you can work with. Again, make sure they are of high character and preferably people that have a giving nature to them. Working with people is not a “taking” process-it is “give and take”, again like all good relationships.</p>

          <p>After you have the team you then have to develop your vision, implement it, and build the entire structural organization to have the organization grow. It works much like a biological model. It will either grow or die. Most things do not stay the same. It is up to the entrepreneur to nurture the vision, hold the management teams hands, monitor the progress, listen to the customers, employees and management team, and hold everyone, including oneself accountable. This holding one accountable, as well as the ability to deal with top people is accomplished much easier and better if one has a religious and ethical life structure to work within, but that will be dealt with in another paper. If you have any questions about this ask the author.</p>

          <p>In order to be successful you must focus on keeping your overhead low and your productivity and effectiveness high. It sounds simple, but most of the pain that is going thought corporate America today is that with time bureaucracy tends to grow and with the advent of the PC the many layers of bureaucracy are not needed anymore. Again, use the biological model. The survival of the fittest rains. If one organization is not as effective as another, the customer will go with the cheaper and more effective. It is not how many politicians say that someone is being “mean spirited”, it is simple the natural law of capitalism that is at play. If you would substitute socialism or communism history has shown us that the bureaucracy grows even faster and larger and a very few with all the networks come out fine, but the masses suffer. Therefore, to date it seems that the capitalistic, and entrepreneurial process within the capitalistic system is the best alternative. There are natural laws that you will have to remember and focus on. The first one is: happiness is a positive cash flow. In starting out you should always know how much money is coming in and how much is going out. This can be done first in your head, then on a scratch piece of paper and then a sophisticated computer system, but you must always be aware what is happening to the cash flow, and you better spending less than you are making most of the time, or life will become very hard and ugly quickly. Again, it will come from investors, bankers, employees (not getting paid), government (not getting their taxes), etc. Therefore, focus on making sure there is always a positive cash flow, and if not, make sure it will only be for a small amount and for a very short time. Do not be fooled that it will improve tomorrow without real reason for it to happen. Many people have seen their organizations collapse while still thinking that it will be better tomorrow.</p>

          <p>Therefore you must focus on these things:</p>

          <p>1. surrounding yourself with people of impeccable character</p>

          <p>2. having a positive cash flow</p>

          <p>3. accomplishing this by satisfying customers “perceived needs and wants”</p>

          <p>Business is simply “risk and reward”. Minimize your risk and attempt to maximize your reward. Deal with it like you do a game. I use the term ‘play’ to look at starting an organization, but I do not mean to take it lightly. There are a few things that you must focus on when thinking about “risk and reward”. Do not put all your eggs in one basket. That is, always have a fall back position. For example, do not mortgage your home in order to finance your start up organization unless you are prepared to loose your home. Think of it just as you would go to Las Vegas for a weekend of gambling. Set aside money that you are willing to loose. Don’t risk everything because most entrepreneurs, even the best of them, had a couple of failures and long struggles before they learned how to do it and get it right. Sam Walton who started Wal-Mart is one of many examples. Do not think that you are better than he was at starting an organization? Next, everything you have and will acquire is on loan to you. That is when you die you will not take it with you. Someone as “how much did J. Paul Getty leave when he died?” The answer was “all of it”. You can’t take it with you so don’t take yourself and some of the situations that you find yourself in so seriously. The most important thing that you will leave is your reputation. If something will not really matter in 100 years from now, do your best, but don’t loose your family or your perspective of life. Now lets go play. </p>

          <p><b>How to Start a Business.</b></p>

          <p>1. <b>Vision</b></p>

          <p>There are a number of books and articles (See Sec. III. 4 and 7 in this paper) on how to start a business. I will attempt to not cover what one would find in these references, but state what I have learned in my own experiences. First of all, you need a <b>basic understanding</b> of <b>accounting</b> and a general feel of <b>flows of funds</b> coming in and out. That is, in attempting to <b>keep it as simple</b> as possible, think of starting as business as turning on a water pipeline with a continuous flow, and you want to keep as much as you can in a reservoir to use in the future when you need more water. Always, have more coming into your reservoir than you have going out. It sounds like a simplistic statement, but you will constantly have employees, consultants, partners, etc. that try to have you let more go out for a while than comes in, for a seemingly good reason, but always insist on having at least a little saved all the time for problem times. (They will come)</p>

          <p>The basic things that will be considered when focusing on <b>vision</b> are asking some of the following questions:</p>

          <p>-What am I going to do? Who will I do it with? What will it take in the way of money and time? Who needs my product and/or service and how much are they willing to pay for it? How much do I think I will make on doing this instead of working at something else? Do I really want to do this and why? The following statement made by Peter Drucker is what you must focus on:</p>

          <p>What is Our Business?</p>

          <p>Who is Our Customers?</p>

          <p>What Does the Customer Consider Value?</p>

          <p>2. <b>Plan</b></p>

          <p>You must plan your time and your energy. If you are starting your own venture you must consider how much time it will take. Do you have a family and how much time do you plan on spending with them. There are a number of personal questions that only you can answer.</p>

          <p>Depending on the size and scope of business venture depends on how much written material you must generate. Some of the material will be in order for you to focus on planning what you want to accomplish and some of it will be for investors or bankers, in order for them to understand what you are attempting to accomplish so they can join your team. If you are doing a small business and need a small amount of money from a kind friend or relative you may be able to jot some notes down on one page. If you are attempting to get a group to invest and go to the bank for a loan you may need a report that is some thousand pages long. For our current discussion we will assume that the business that you are starting is small, but will still need a bank loan. Therefore, we must do a Business Plan.</p>

          <p><b>The Table of Contents</b> must be very clear. Most “money people” are very busy and will not take much time on any one project. If you want them to consider your project you must put it in a format that is so clear and flows smoothly, but at the same time is presented in such a way that you truly sound that you know what you are writing and talking about and that you have the confidence and the ability to accomplish the venture.</p>

          <p><b>The Summary</b> is included for the same reason that the Table of Contents. The person reading the business plan will more than likely only glance at the Summary and the Conclusion. If they are very interested in the project they may turn it over to someone else to go over all the details, so all the details must fit, make common sense and be reliable, but the Summary and the Conclusion must make sense, be clear and create enthusiasm in the reader.</p>

          <p><b>The General Company Description</b> tells the reader in plan and simple language what the business does and how it will be run. One should be able to understand how the business will serve its customers, who will communicate to whom and what will happen on a day to day basis as well what will the investors, owners, employees, and customers expect in the long term.</p>

          <p><b>The Business’ Legal Form</b> will depend on ownership, country, tax situation of all parties, and potential liabilities of each segment of the business. The format of the business, sole ownership, C-Corp., S-Corp., Limited Liability, Company, Partnership, etc. depending on what country and what legal entity is chosen should be clearly stated and described. In addition, it should be stated why this particular form was chosen.</p>

          <p><b>The Products and Services</b> will require more detail than the first four sections of the business plan. Here one should be extremely detailed and descriptive. Any product that will be supplied will have to have an explanation how the product will be manufactured, sold, distributed, shipped, inventoried, etc. All services must be described and all the products and people who are needed in the service process must be described. Any systems and general business procedures that will be set up in order to process and supply the product or service to the customer must be explained in detail.</p>

          <p><b>The Marketing Plan </b>should go into every detail that you are considering. That is, why will someone buy your product and/or service before they buy someone else’s? Who is your competition, and what is to prevent more competition coming on line when you start? Who is your market and can they afford your product and/or service? What does your customers perceive as value? Marketing is the future and the future is uncertain. Therefore, we do not forecast the future but we keep playing with various likely scenarios about the future. This is done by having people in each country that we do business in with their ears not only to the ground, but listening everywhere, constantly and reporting to each other what is happening. This marketing process, of listening, is done on a constant basis and a data base is kept on a real time basis on other product and service demand as well as complete business information. Flexibility and simplicity is emphasized along with performance and effectiveness. You are concentrate on dealing with four scenarios. They are 1. Events are going well, 2. Events are going OK, 3. Events are going worst than expected, and 4. Events are going bad. Also, do not forget “<b>Markets Make Businesses, Businesses Do Not Make Markets”. </b>You want to design your new enterprise from the outside, understand what is going on in the world, determine what target market has a problem, and then turn inside your enterprise to have your people use the resources you have at your disposal to solve the problems. Go into the<b> History</b> of your market. How has your product and/or service been handled in the past? When did it start? What is the total history of your industry? Then, how do you see the <b>future</b> of your industry? The <b>strategic</b> <b>marketing focus</b> your enterprise has had in the past is based on the information you have learned from others. The present and probable future is based on keeping in touch with what the local consumers desire, and can afford in your market. Your strategic focus should then be described in detail. Why is your way better than all the other ways? Why will people come to you instead of all their other choices? Then, you must describe your strategic action plan that shows your marketing plan in detail. It will include your projected growth of sales, number of sales per salesperson, etc. </p>

          <p><b>The Operation Plan </b>will then go into all the details on how you will supply your customers with your product and/or service. It will describe your accounting system, your sales team, your distribution channels, your incentive program and retirement program. You will talk about your management team. At first it might just be you, but whom will it include after one year and how will you motivate them to stay with you instead of jumping the ship and going off with your competition?</p>

          <p><b>Management &amp; Organization</b> should describe how the company is organized. This can be done with an organizational chart and/or resumes on each of the management team, going into their complete backgrounds. People that are investing in organizations like to see if the people that are actually doing the work have done similar things before. It does seem unfair that the people that need the money usually do not have experience, but reality is such that the money people know that it is much less risky going with people that are doing something over again, than with people that are doing something for the first time. Think of it like a sports game. (In fact, that is a good way of looking at business as a whole-one big serious game.) Do you want a goalie in for a championship soccer game that has never played the game before? He might be good a tennis, but soccer is something else.</p>

          <p><b>Major Milestones</b> are events that have already occurred that will help you accomplish your overall goal of operating the business. They may be small events like getting a business license or they may be major events as receiving a patent that causes your product line to be far better than anything on the market All the milestones should be listed to show a progression of how things have been going in the history of the company. If it is a brand new company, you should list when people came together and when ideas were put together.</p>

          <p><b>Structure and Capitalization</b> will define who is in charge and what they have to loose. Most investors want the person who is asking for money to have a lot at stake. In situations that the person does not have a major portion of their assets at stake, they may have a tendency to leave when the “going gets tough”. Western bankers are very good at making sure that when they loan money, they are the first to get it back. You must describe how the formal structure of the organization is put together and with a description of who has what to gain and loose, in other words, who is putting up the capital.</p>

          <p><b>The Financial Plan</b> will give a projected month by month profit and loss-cash flow of the entire operation for at least three years. In addition, a five year projection per year should be included with all the numbers fitting together. Again, it is very difficult to project into the future, in fact impossible, so the best format for financial projected plans is to look at a number of scenarios. With the marvel of computerized spreadsheets one can quickly make changes to projections. All of your financial projections should be done based on what you feel will happen. Then think of all the realistic down turns that may occur and make those adjustments. After you have become very realistic and somewhat discouraged then make one that takes into account all the things that could happen that could make things better. At the end of the process you should have a set of three that will get you through most situations that will occur. On the average it seems that things take three times longer and costs three times more than most people plan for. This is not to say that you shouldn’t do it, but you should be ready. Your financial plan should give you the objectivity to be ready for any future financial set back or opportunity. You might not feel comfortable in talking with your investors or bankers on all the down turns you come up with, but you should be ready and have a plan in your own mind. The reason to put it on paper is to again make it as simple as possible to get the many things done that you will have to deal with in starting and operating a business. It also helps to write down your financial goal, because I have found that usually what you put to serious writing and focus on it, somehow it comes to being. There is not an explanation for why or how this occurs, but it seems to work if you will write a detailed realistic plan for all of your goals and keep focused on them, they eventually happen, baring some extraordinary unpredictable occurrence.</p>

          <p><b>The Economic Climate</b> of the country, region, and industry should also be addressed. Is it a stable economy (if there is such a thing in today’s world)? Is the market that you are aiming for a mature market or a new one? That is are you attempting to sell a commodity or a very new invention. Are the customers able to afford the product and are they able to understand it. If it takes a long educational curve you must take that into account. You should spend a great deal of time thinking and rethinking the environment that you will be working in. What is the economic world like that you will be in?</p>

          <p><b>The Model Companies</b> that you are going to be competing with should be defined. There are very few truly new ideas and products. What are the companies that are existing in a different region that you might model yours after? Why are they successful and can you duplicate that success? You should take the time to describe exactly, in very small detail, what you want and compare it to everything that you have done to date. Does it fit with your financial plans? Does it fit with your personal goals?</p>

          <p><b>The Conclusion</b> should take everything that you have written in the above process and put it on no more than one page.</p>

          <p><b>The Index</b> should help you keep things simple and organized. You may want to add an appendix to help describe related material. </p>

          <p>Let me back up a minute. One should really think about if they really want to start their own business. First of all it is suggested that one should buy an existing business instead of starting from scratch because it has been proven that the success rate is so much better buying than starting. I will address buying a business in a following section. Also, it sounds like the perfect way to go to have your own business, but it takes many hours and more than likely you will always have to answer to someone, you will never get away from that. And, it is extremely lonely owning your own business, because there are few places you can go in order to communicate with people on your own level. When things are going great, you are not needed and when things are going terrible you will have all the responsibilities and everyone will be looking to you. Owning a business is certainly not for everyone and one should spend much time considering all the negatives before you attempt to start it. Work is work. You might enjoy going to the health club and figure it sure will be fun owning one so you can be there everyday and make money while having fun. But as soon as it is business, it will be work. I am not saying not to do it, I am simply saying really search your gifts and desires and think it through after talking to people that you respect. </p>

          <p>Set up a system and procedure to collect information. It might mean having meetings to find out what customers and employees like and dislike, or joining trade associations, reading newspapers, etc., but your success today will be based on the correct information that you collect on what your customer desires and the thoughts and feelings of your employees and associates. Listen.</p>

          <p>OK it has been decided to start a business. One is convinced that it will be very successful and profitable and there is absolutely no way to buy one. Only start as the wise man said about deciding to get married, "Only get married when you can not not get married. That is when one feels that they cannot live without being married." Starting a business is somewhat like that. Besides all the things that will be found in the "How To" books one must protect their time. Set goals and plan time buy the week, day and hour. One needs so much time for personal daily events like brushing of teeth, etc. Then comes talking to associates, vendors, customers, governmental inspectors, CPA's, attorney's, politicians, auditors, potential buy out prospects, bankers, sales people, potential employees, potential partners, etc. This is in addition to the time for one's family. Therefore, it is extremely important to <b>protect and plan your time.</b></p>

          <p>Again, the other books will go into setting goals and making business plans. Just make sure there is enough time, energy and desire to do all the steps that will be needed in order to make the business successful.</p>

          <p><b>How to buy a business</b></p>

          <p>An overview of how to start going about the process of buying a business is much like the same process that one must go through in starting a business. It is suggested that you go over all the steps and process that are defined in the “How to Start A Business” section of this paper. The overall question that you must ask yourself is “Why do you want to buy the particular business”? After you feel that you have answered that question talk to people that you respect that know you very well and attempt to take a true, objective look at what you feel will really happen. Then go through all the steps in “How to Start A Business” above before you continue.</p>

          <p>Make sure you ask yourself what else you can do with your time and money? Is buying a business the best thing you can do with your life and is this particular business that you are looking at the best one. It is advisable to buy instead of start because the risk is usually so much smaller and the reward greater for the amount of time and money it will take. </p>

          <p>You should pay somewhere between three to seven times the projected earnings of the business. It does not matter how much they are asking, or how much it is appraised for, but how much you will get on a return by operating it. The appraisal and asking price are certainly going to affect your buying price, but they should not be the focus of your buying process. Note also that a larger, professionally operated business is worth more than an owner operated business. If you can buy it and the management team stays the same you will probably be able to pay more than the 3 to 7 times formula. Where does that formula come from? Remember you have the option of putting your money into other, very much safer investments by buying public stock. What will be your return there without very much hassle and time and effort spent? Also, as was mentioned when we were discussing doing P&amp;L and cash flow projections, it is impossible to predict the future and at best it is only a guess what will happen after three years. Well if you pay more than three times the projected income of a business for it you are relying on the fact that the future will be the same or better for that particular business beyond the third year in the future. This is not to say that you are going to pay three times of what they are currently making with the business. After you go through the process that is outlined in “How to Turn A Business Around” you should be able to come up with a number of ways to improve the profit and give yourself a comfort level that makes is worth while to proceed with.</p>

          <p>Again one will find many books on the steps that must be done as due diligence, financing, etc. Some of these books are listed at the back of this paper, but any library or bookstore will devote entire sections to this subject. Also, as was stated earlier do not attempt to do all the research on acquiring a business by yourself. Hire the best people to help you do an objective job. Surround yourself with people of the highest character. This is the only long term way to accomplish a long term business plan. The people that you have around you, on your team are a reflection and represent you. You must be respected in order to “earn the right to be heard” by all that you come in contact with in business. Again, I am speaking of the long term with a small to medium sized business organization. In addition<b>,</b> you must earn the respect and confidence of the seller or sellers. It will complicate things if there are more than one seller, but one must <b>focus on what the seller wants. Listen. </b>If they trust you, you can buy their business with no or very little cash down. If they do not trust you, you might as well go on your way. You also must give the seller ample security in order that if something goes wrong beyond your control they will not be hurt. </p>

          <p>What you must look for in a business after you have answered all the questions above is a business that fits your life style, one that you know the industry very well, or can learn about it very quickly and extensively, one that you can afford, and one that you will fit into the culture of.</p>

          <p>Your style of life is different than anyone’s. You are a unique person. There is only one of you and you have certain expectation of yourself and of the people you are closest to. Do not attempt to put yourself in an entirely foreign culture and be successful overnight is a business. It will take time if you want to go to a foreign country and buy a business. This also holds true within a specific country. Each existing business has its own culture. This is made up of the history, owners, employees, etc. of each specific organization. Not any two are exactly alike. You can find very similar ones in franchise situations, but on the whole each organization has its own distinct culture. When you go to buy one, make sure you understand it and that you will fit into it.</p>

          <p>You best know the industry or make sure you learn it very quickly before you buy into it. Warren Buffett gives very good advice when he says that he does not invest in any business that he does not understand. For that reason he is not in high technology businesses. He also gives good advice when he emphasizes that he buys businesses that have good people in place and all he asks of them is to let him know of the big problems, because he does not want any surprises and for the managers to treat the business as if it is his own. These “Buffett suggestions” also apply to a business that you are looking to buy. It will be very difficult for you to make good, sound decisions if you do not understand the details of what is going on.</p>

          <p>Some people attempt to buy things that they really can not afford. Make sure that you can afford the business you are looking at buying. There are a number of ways to lease, borrow, bring in partners and the like to allow you to afford much more than you can alone. When it comes down to the time to make a decision to go on with it or not because of the money required you should send time with your banker, attorney and accountant. They will know many different avenues, but don’t bite off more than you can chew.</p>

          <p>Next, understand the culture of the business. Are the people satisfied or is there an unruliness. Are the employees honest and trustworthy. Think of the company as you would a family and also a country. Apply all that you have learned in sociology to this particular business organization and then answer if you think and feel you fit into it. Of course there will be significant changes when you buy it, but a culture is hard to change quickly so be realistic. </p>

          <p>The following is a real example of how to buy a business:</p>

          <p>There was a fellow who owned a corrugated box company that had lost $700k per year for three years straight. He found a consultant who told him to "make a list of the main competition and see if any of them would sell out for a 'fair price'." The fellow found one that said he would sell out for $1M, because he had also lost $700k per year for a couple of years. After doing much "due diligence" the buyer offered the seller $300k cash and a note at 10% for 15 years on the balance. After that was agreed (The seller felt like he was taking advantage of the poor guy) the consultant arranged a 90 day, high interest loan for $300k on the seller's assets. As soon as the seller was given the $300k down the buyer moved all the production to his plant and operated it on a 24 hour basis. He then sold the equipment at the other plant for $200k, inventory that was not needed for $100k and the building and real estate for $400k. After paying back the $300k loan in 60 days from the time that it was borrowed the buyer put $400k cash in his bank and has been making $1M per year since.</p>

          <p>The key points in buying an existing business are:</p>

          <p>1. Doing "<b>due diligence</b>". Having as good idea as possible how well what the seller says is, is actually the way things are. And, being able to really do what you think you can with the new business.</p>

          <p>2. <b>Keep everything as simple</b> as you can and managing the balance sheet as well as the profit and loss sheet. For example, sell off equipment, inventory that is not absolutely needed and collect accounts receivable faster.</p>

          <p>3. <b>Earn the sellers trust </b>and <b>treat them as you would want to be treated.</b> If they feel you are dishonest you will find it very hard to ever buy another business.</p>

          <p>In addition to these simplistic statements and outline there are a number of books on the subject, some of which are listing in the back of this paper. One should also consult someone that can be trusted in the area that my give you an opinion of the economy and the general well being of the proposed transaction.</p>

          <p>In conclusion, it is normally much lower risk buying a business than starting from scratch. On the other hand you must eliminate as many existing risks as possible and be realistic in thinking that you can project what will happen in the future. Since most small to medium sized private businesses fail because of relationship breakdown you must focus on the relationships of all the people who will be involved. I you should read, understand, and use the processes that Roger Fisher suggests in the books, “Getting to Yes” and “Getting Together”. When negotiating you must get creative and come up with many alternatives. Do not simply let the price become the issue. For example, you may suggest that the seller receives a consulting contract with all expenses paid for some time period. Threat the seller with respect and have him or her very pleased with the sale so he or she will tell others and you can continue your buying process. </p>

          <p>How to Turn-Around a Business.</p>

          <p>The details of this process will vary with each organization, but we will discuss some general processes. Again in brief one should simplify as much as possible.</p>

          <p>Strategy</p>

          <p>The first process is to go into the business organization and communicate face to face with the person in charge, if it were the owner, president or major stockholder. The first step should be attempted in a couple of hours of time. The first question is to ask, “Why are we here?” In other words find out why he or she thinks there is a problem and why he or she thinks that the company needs to be turned around. Some of the time it is very apparent, but many times the one in charge is the last to accept it. Then ask them to describe the problem. Is it the market, production, etc. Move fast - do not get into details at this time. You want to get an overview of what the general problem is. After you hear from them what the problem is you then explain what you are going to do and approximately that it will take a day or so to get on top of it.</p>

          <p>The next step is to get a detailed picture of what is going on within the organization and its relationship to the outside world. First go over the basic major events of history of the company. When was it founded and by who? Is it a public company and when did they establish certain products and services? </p>

          <p>Then, who are the owners and what is the split of the stock or ownership? Do the owners agree on what the problems are? Who runs the day to day operation and who owns most of the company? Find out who has control and who has the most to loose if things go bad.</p>

          <p>Have them describe the product line and/or services provided. This should be detailed and understood why their product and/or service is thought to be better than everyone else’s.</p>

          <p>What geographical area is the market? Is the market one location, regional, national or global? </p>

          <p>How does the company sell? Do they use their own employees, reps., distributors, etc.? </p>

          <p>What were their sales and profits for the last five years? Also, find out if there was a marketable change at any one time and why they think that it occurred.</p>

          <p>Have them describe the flow process for manufacturing or processes of providing service for a service company. How does the day to day operation work in an overview? </p>

          <p>Does the company have a new product or service that they have just implemented or plans to implement? What is the opinion of the owner of the products and services that they now provide?</p>

          <p>Are there any major quality problems out in the field currently? Is the major financial problems directly related to quality problems or operational problems? </p>

          <p>Are there any law suits or summons for judgments existing against the organization? How bad are things and are you doing to have to get the attorney’s involved at this time?</p>

          <p>Are there any problems in production? Can the production department produce? </p>

          <p>Who are the major five competitors? Is the existing competition larger or smaller than you? What percentage of market share does each of you have? Is the market share changing currently?</p>

          <p>Do they have too many products that they sell? Are they attempting to be too many things to too many different people and not being the best at any one of them?</p>

          <p>Is their inventory out of balance? What is the turn over rate of the inventory? Is it necessary to carry as large and inventory as they presently do?</p>

          <p>Are they anticipating missing the next payroll? Is everyone currently up to date on their pay?</p>

          <p>If they anticipate missing the next payroll, stop. Now work on a 12 week cash plan. What you have to spend money on? What will come in and what will go out? Some weeks will be O. K. and some weeks bad so spread cash out. Deal with the trade. (This may take a day or so longer if it is a real mess.)</p>

          <p>Are they going to have any problem getting raw material into the company and are they going to have any problem with payroll? Get a general flavor. What are the problems, what they do, rough out what is the organization? </p>

          <p>Steps on Investigation</p>

          <p>After you have processed the information that you have on the organization it is time to do a liquidation analysis in order to:</p>

          <p>1. See the situation as objectively as possible, and</p>

          <p>2. Look at the situation as the current lender is probably looking at it.</p>

          <p>First, you want to find out how much more can the bank lend to cover some of the valleys of cash that may be needed. More than likely you will not be able to change banks at this time before you get a plan together so you must figure out how much more their bank can lend. Getting them to actually make the commitment to lend more is a different story, but the first step is to see what they are able to do. With that information in hand you can then start a plan.</p>

          <p>Is the guarantee of the guarantors exposed? In other words, are the personal assets of the owners at risk? This is a very key point in negotiating with the bank. They will look upon the situation entirely differently depending on the answer of this question. It is not to say that at any time are we planning on not meeting the company’s financial commitments, but the timing in situations, as this is crucial.</p>

          <p>Some basis for liquidation assumptions are as follows:</p>

          <p>1. It will take three to six months time with cooperation of owners and management to liquidate a business. </p>

          <p>(Bank can lend safely on that basis.)</p>

          <p>2. Good debtors are fortune 1,000 companies. (Except retailers) And debtors are not customers, customers.</p>

          <p>3. High service requirement products have more influence on recoverability on A/R than poor debtors do on A/R. That is for example computer computers are not as valuable as wheat. You might not be able to turn around and sell computers as you can wheat. </p>

          <p>Accounts receivable are one of the fastest and most reliable places to look for liquidity in a business organization. Our first step is to categories the existing receivable. The percentage is the amount of the total receivable that a lender could advance with cash and still be in a safe position because they will be able to collect it in the future if the company has major problems. Below is the way to categorize the organizations receivable:</p>

          <p>70% AGood DebtorLow ServiceOnly Under 90 days</p>

          <p>50% BGood DebtorHigh ServiceAll Other Out</p>

          <p>60% CPoor DebtorLow Service</p>

          <p>40% DPoor DebtorHigh Service(Computer System 10%)</p>

          <p>If someone does 80% they will include the inventory also. Below is how to grade the inventory in order to loan on it. These percentages are a rough estimate, but they work in most cases.</p>

          <p>Age of Inventory Under 4 MonthsOver 4 Months</p>

          <p>A Good DebtorLow Service 70%30%</p>

          <p>BGood DebtorHigh Service50%20%</p>

          <p>C Poor DebtorLow Service50%20%</p>

          <p>D Poor DebtorHigh Service20% )</p>

          <p>Balance portion of the inventory we will assume can be liquidated in four months time. This depends on what shape the inventory is in. You must break the inventory into raw materials work in progress and finished goods and look to see what percentage is each. Take finished goods and look at what it will sell for. Take the work in progress and find out what will it take to get it into finished goods. How many months of inventory do we have? The less sure you are the more conservative you must become.</p>

          <p>When looking at the machinery and equipment you must first assume that you are in a recession period. The breakdown of looking at machinery and equipment is as follows:</p>

          <p>1. 2/3 depreciatedNormal-Special</p>

          <p>50% 25% Original Purchase Price</p>

          <p>2. 40%-60% depreciated50% 25% Book Value</p>

          <p>3. 1/3 or less depreciated25% 20% Book Value</p>

          <p>This holds to for the economic period from 1979 to 1996. In general the above chart works for all equipment but vehicles. Normal-standard equipment is not customized. Normal equipment has a pretty good population of it. Special equipment has to be altered. All vehicles can be appraised by an outside appraiser or published book. All the equipment should be checked to make sure it has been reasonably maintained. In this chart it is assumed that the equipment has been reasonably maintained.</p>

          <p>Real estate collateral for business loans, and not strictly real estate loans, can be looked as raw land and built out. Raw land can take a loan of 30% of estimated market value less liens and accruals. Commercial real estate can be categorized as 50% if 1.5 times the building size is land and all other is treated as raw land. Residential real estate can take up to 65% of market value, minus liens and accruals and condos and townhouses 50% of market value, minus liens and accruals. </p>

          <p>When it comes to office equipment you can take 10% of the original purchase price in order to figure how much a lender will lend on it.</p>

          <p>In studying the remainder of the assets on the books you can assume that a lender will not loan anything on patents, tooling, capitalized R&amp;D, goodwill etc. Life insurance can be considered worth its cash value. Notes due from employees are worth nothing where as accounts receivable notes, non trade can be discounted 30% or worth 70% of their face value.</p>

          <p>At this time add up all the percentage values of all the assets and this number equals the liquidated value of assets. When you subtract 100% of the liabilities you come up with the liquidated net worth.</p>

          <p>Now is the time to ask&lt; “What do we really have to pay out and when?” That is, liabilities that must be paid in the liquidation over a course of 3-6 months. Accrued expenses (payroll and taxes, 10% of accounts payable, and sometimes only 5% because you only have to order 50% of what you need to liquidate. </p>

          <p>We are going to assume that all bank debt will be paid back because it is secured. All mortgage debt that is secured, as equipment and vehicles and if any stockholders have liens. Liens have to be on for at least a year to be perfected. If it is a bank it has to be on for at least three months before bankrupt proceedings. If a creditor wants a UCC-1 you have them tell them that you must ask your bank, because most banks will not allow you to give it to others.</p>

          <p>After considering all of these above issues we then add this total back to the liquidated net worth to get the Revised Liquidated Net Worth. By doing this we can tell where the bank is at and where they will be coming from when we meet with them. Are they overexposed or can we borrow more from them without them becoming overexposed. </p>

          <p>This procedure is needed to buy time. The intentions, and it has been found in more than 90% of the historical cases when this process is used that the business organization can be fixed and the lender, owner and company can make adjustments in order to become profitable again, but they need time.</p>

          <p>Now it is time to make changes and get more cash coming into the organization than going out. First lets look at the accounts receivable.</p>

          <p>The accounts receivable aging should be analyzed by looking at the percentage of the total aging over 90 days. If 5% is over 90 days be careful, and if over 10% is over 90 days it can be considered an emergency. Also, if dilution is over 6% there is a problem. Dilution is the gross sales minus the net sales deviled by gross sales. Return, credits, mistakes, canceled sales, etc. constitute the difference and if this number is over 6% of sales you must fix the problems quickly. Foreign accounts receivable are not eligible in many cases when dealing with lenders. This depends on what type of business and as more businesses become global in nature this will change, but at this time most lenders still see foreign trade as a high risk that they will not get involved with. In order to deal with foreign business it is best to have them furnish you with letters of credit, LC’s. Any customer over 10% of the total receivable is a problem. You must make these customers pay faster so that they are not 10% or greater of your total accounts receivable or get others to buy more from you to balance it out. Your company is too vulnerable relying so much on one customer. When they leave you are in trouble and as soon as they know that they may take advantage of you. If your large customer gives you a bad time about this requirement you can use your bank as an excuse. Another place that your bank will be looking is contra accounts, that is when the same people you sell to buy from you and you offset. The bank will not loan you any amount on these types of customers. This is not to say that they are bad in any way, the banks simply do not like the situation because they may not be able to collect there money in the future. When a customer is over 90 days with 20% of his total amount owed he is worth nothing for the entire amount and stop shipping to him. If you find any customer over $1,000 in the over 90 day column you should contact them personally. In fact, divide and have each executive responsible to collect a certain amount. Take the top 80% of your delinquent accounts and have your executives call on them and have your clerks call on the bottom 20%. Also, list the delinquent accounts receivable with the largest amounts at the top. Do not look at the accounts receivable by alphabetical order, but by order of importance to your company. Do what ever it takes to get all the accounts receivable within terms. All that new cash will come in handy. With the accounts that you cannot collect, do not get a collection agency, but get an attorney. Give them 10 days, but don’t waste time. If under $1,500 go to small claims court. All the rest have the attorney take legal action quickly. You must start taking actions that will do everything to lower your risk.</p>

          <p>Set goals that will all improve the cash position. These goals will include sales, collection, A/R., cash, etc. Take action. When you do not reach the goal you change and do something and be assertive. You must portray the “sense of urgency”. If you do not think there is a “sense of urgency” you can take a minute and see all that has been built up liquidated by your lender and all of your loyal employees and associates hating you because you let them down by letting them be laid off. You must take action and it has to be currently, not wait a day to see if things will get better by themselves. They won’t.</p>

          <p>Next you must focus on your accounts payable. Make sure you pay people on time, but not early. Watch every cent that goes out on a daily basis until you cash flow is fixed. At the same time you are checking the credit of all your customers, learn something about your vendors. Can you take more time with one than another without causing them alarm? If you have any vendor over 10% see if you can get less dependent. Use someone else’s credit as well as his or hers. Also, look for contras. See if you can trade services or products so you can have more cash coming from your customers while at the same time you to not have the outlay of the cash. Get a feeling of where you are with the trade. If trade payable total is equal to or over month sales you are in a dangerous situation and you must start looking to reduce debt. Don’t do anything to hurt any of your trade, but you may have to slow so payments to survive. Finance companies want to lend amount of money that is enough to have companies continue, in addition they want enough money to wipe off all debt over 60 days. This tells you what your maximum trade payable condition can be.</p>

          <p>At this time you should step back and take an overview of where things stand. You need to write a list of assumptions for every cash disbursement. Why does this dollar have to go out?, is a very common question at this time. Take time each day to track all A/R transactions, revolving loan transactions, availability of money agreed upon from the lender, and day to day cash improvement goal. Continue to monitor the cash improvement short term plan and goal and also see how you are standing on the over 60 day plan. Keep looking at the 12 months ahead and see the trend you are on and see where you will be in 12 months if things keep to the trend. Watch the P&amp;L on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis until the cash situation is corrected. Are you on track with the profit improvement goal? What amount of cash will be needed now?</p>

          <p>To take further action you need feedback. Make sure if you are working with a management team that they are all involved. Most people want the credit and the fame and fortune, but not the responsibility. This is human nature. We were speaking before about a biological model when describing the growth of a business. Now we must focus on a physiological model. People do not like pain and a business origination that is in a turn around position is a very painful place to be. Everyone is attempting to look out for theirs and their family’s well being as well as attempting to look out for the organization. They do not want to be blamed, so they do not want responsibility. They do though want things better. This is why it is so important when starting a business and buying a business that you focus on people of very high character. When you play “hard ball” many people tend to want to cheat, pass the buck, responsibility, and put their head in the sand. It is a normal human response. Now it is time for the key people to step up and get involved. The following are the steps to put them through. Do not let them do their first reaction and put the ball back into your court, that is the responsibility. You are to ask every key person and employee: </p>

          <p>1. What can the organization do without and when, during the subsequent one year period?</p>

          <p>2. What overall or category price increases can be made and when?</p>

          <p>3. Repeat question 1. now that the distance to the improvement goals are apparent.</p>

          <p>4. What individual product and/or service price increases are possible, over and above those in question?</p>

          <p>5. What can be done differently? Begin with the identification of product and/or services that are not contributing sufficiently to overhead and profit.</p>

          <p>Implement all these answers and changes as soon as possible.</p>

          <p>Now there is to be two lender meetings. First at the end of the first week you need to meet with the lender and define the few commitments of change that the management team has made. Then at the end of the first month the next meeting is to show the lender and each member of the team all the commitments from the management business plan that is in place. At this time it is important to set up a reporting system for the lender and internal communication. How are we doing? How are things improving? When there are significant improvements each person that takes part should have a significant reward in the way of a raise or a bonus. These should be significant enough that the families of each of the team members are pleased. When things were in bad shape the family members took a lot of the heat and frustration and they should now receive some of the rewards for the improvement. Remember you have to work through the head of the organization. Where ever the buck stops is where the pain and the rewards will fall.</p>

          <p>In conclusion it is to be understood that this is not the end. One will find that as time goes on the same bureaucracy and overhead growth will continue with time. Going back to that biological model. As a person ages they tend to gain weight. It takes a continuous effort to shed that weight periodically. You can see it in many social and political behaviors. It can be seen in most governments when looking over a period of time. Think now back to what we were saying about starting a business. After turning around a business you can go back to some of the basic things that it takes to start one and continue to redefine it. Now is the time to listen to your stockholders, management team, employees, customers, etc. and improve to become more effective in order to survive with respect, dignity, and comfort. Remember you must make a significant profit in your organization in order to cover for your mistakes, because you are bound to make mistakes. Now if you think that you are infallible then you do not have to make a profit. Also since we have said that we are going to play the game we might as well have fun at it.</p>

          <p>In order to see a simple example of how this process works we will look at a real example of a large newspaper that was loosing in excess of $2M per year and had run out of cash. The first step is to again understand the processes, systems and procedures as much as possible. In the newspaper example a consultant told the president of the newspaper to reduce the raw paper inventory from a month supply to two days. The operational people said it could not be done, but the consultant’s response was that if they did not do it, they would all be out of jobs in a few weeks anyway. After getting their attention and implementing "just in time" inventory they were able to put $2M cash in the bank. It was then assessed that they must reduce the office staff and reporters by 60%. The president said that was impossible. The consultant then said to lay all the reporters off except for two. He told the president that those two reporters could watch CNN each night and collect the news that way. It turned out that they ended up with about 40% of the original reporters, made $1M the next year and saved the jobs of the remaining employees of the newspaper. </p>

          <p>The best way to look at cuts is to imagine your home on fire and you have enough time to get just the most important things out of it before the whole is lost. In the same way when a business is loosing money you must cut until the loss is stopped. Business collects fat just as a person usually does over time. It happens to the best and gets harder to keep it off as time goes by. Therefore, in order to turn a business around, you go through following steps:</p>

          <p>1. <b>Cut all that you can </b>with still being operational</p>

          <p>2. <b>Raise as much prices</b> as possible.</p>

          <p>3. <b>Listen and learn and repeat </b>1 &amp; 2 above.</p>

          <p>Also, do not panic. Find a few people you trust and respect and talk to them. Have them listen to you and listen to what they feed back to you. But, take action very quickly. Do not wait for "the market" or "industry" to improve. It might, but you do not have the time to wait. If it does, you will just be that better off. As was said to me, "If you do not lay off those 'good old employees' the bank will take over and they certainly will." You must focus on the whole and not just one segment. Everyone must carry themselves. It is true, "there are no free lunches" even though Washington DC. and the Communist Party in the Former Soviet Union try and tried to convince us that there are. We must be responsible for our own actions and pull our load. That means as an individual, division, company, etc.</p>

          <p>In all aspects of business it is important to keep it as simple as possible because it will get complicated very fast anyway. Also, you will not ever have enough time to solve all the problems so you are better off attempting to keep things as simple as you can. A few simple statements to focus on are the following:</p>

          <p>1. <b>Find the market</b> that is there - do not attempt to create one - it cannot be done.</p>

          <p>2. Do something, learn what happened, <b>learn and improve</b>, and do the something again, and repeat.</p>

          <p>3. Always <b>have a positive cash flow</b>.</p>

          <p>4. Always <b>save for a rainy day</b>, when you do not have a positive cash flow.</p>

          <p>5. Concentrate on cash, profit is secondary.</p>

          <p>6. Four financial statements</p>

          <p>1. One to operate your business - done internally.</p>

          <p>2. One for the bank - done by the CPA.</p>

          <p>3. One for the IRS - done by the CPA.</p>

          <p>4. One in order to <b>build wealth</b> - done by you.</p>

          <p>This process of learning how to turn a business organization around is also useful in the following ways:</p>

          <p>1. To improve your existing profitability</p>

          <p>2. Analyze a business in order to buy it, and</p>

          <p>3. Give you a feel of how your banker sees you and a prospective buyer.</p>

          <p>1. Story</p>

          <p>The story that will be told is how two people set up a worldwide business so that they could truly call the "Whole Earth" home. In addition they were able to be self sufficient, help their fellow man and spread the word of God. This is not to say that they became extremely wealthy, but they lived a nice financial life and enjoyed what God furnished.</p>

          <p>The names of the main characters in this story are Sue and Kay. You can substitute any names you would like, but it is not suggested that you attempt to do what they accomplished by yourself, because it is hard enough for two, if not an entire army.</p>

          <p>After graduating from college Sue and Kay sat down and decided that they would set their goals and define what they wanted to accomplish before they settled down and live in the area of their respective choices. They made lists and spent days deciding if they even wanted to attempt to do anything together because the more they communicated the more they found that they were different. After tears, arguments, much soul searching, real communication, and prayer they concluded that they were so different they would probably make for good partners. The one thing they established beyond doubt was that they trusted each other and looked out for the others best interests. Also, one long term goal they both had was to someday get married and raise a family. They spent time talking to friends, mentors and family attempting to predict if they built a sufficient business would it cause them both to be so independent that they would find it harder in the future to find a life long mate. Again, after hours of prayer and debate they concluded if a male's self esteem and ego was so fragile that he could not join in or "do his own thing" they would just have to find the right one that God had for them.</p>

          <p>Without going into all the alternatives we will only deal with the conclusions they came to. Their goals were as follows:</p>

          <p><u >SueKay</p>

          <p>Live inCaliforniaVirginia</p>

          <p>2nd Vacation HomeMaine Hawaii</p>

          <p>Spend 1/4 of working time in Europe Asia</p>

          <p>After 5 years, weekly time at</p>

          <p>work planned3025</p>

          <p>Income Level after 5 years </p>

          <p>(Per year)$200,000 $150,000</p>

          <p>Savings set aside for retirement</p>

          <p>(Per year)$30,000$40,000</p>

          <p>Sue as a generalist and Kay a detail person. It was decided that Sue would concentrate on Marketing, Sales, Human Aspects of the Business, General Management and Creating and managing International Business Relationships while Kay would focus on Management Control, Financial Management, Decision Analysis, Business, Government, and the International Economy. For example, Kay concluded that they wanted at least one of the following in the US.:</p>

          <p>1. A partnership</p>

          <p>2. A C-Corporation</p>

          <p>3. A S-Corporation</p>

          <p>and later a non-profit foundation that they would fund after the above were rolling.</p>

          <p>As far as Sue was concerned-sales were sales, profit was profit, cash was cash and it did not make any difference to her which entity received the credit. Sue liked to spend more money than Kay so they set it up that Sue's income was greater and Kay ended up with a larger percentage of the company's in the long run, but they both had a equal 50/50 say in the business. They decided they wanted to learn about the world and travel so they set a goal to have offices in the following cities:</p>

          <p>Honolulu, Los Angeles, Denver, Chicago, Toronto, New York, Rio De Janeiro, London, Paris, Berlin, Helsinki, St. Petersburg, Dubai, Johannesburg, New Delhi, Beijing, Hong Kong, Tokyo, Sydney and Wellington.</p>

          <p>Manufacturing was not their background and they came to the conclusion that it would take to much capital to start from scratch in manufacturing because of all the equipment, accounts receivable and inventory needed, so they concluded they would start in a service business then move into distribution, retail, and then manufacturing. The conclusion was to set a plan and goals that could be reached in 7 years so they could decide at that time if they wanted to sell out or continue. They would both be 29 at that time and they had other personal plans. The overall time line was set as follows:</p>

          <p>Year 1&amp; 2 Service, add Retail 3 &amp; 4, add distribution 5 and add manufacturing 6 and 7. Now they needed: 1. an accountant, 2. an attorney, 3. bank, 4. market information, 5. and a plan.</p>

          <p>The journey began by one of them coming up with the idea that they could start a service business the day after they graduated. It seems that they were in luck that they just happened to be going to a college that was in a very high income area and also a high risk area for brush fires. They found out when and where the Fire Marshall was going and they followed him to suggest that they coordinate with some of the football players a service to clear fire breaks. As they added more football players, soccer, basketball, base ball and swimmers they had to hire a couple of dispatchers and a full time sales person. As they saved money they had enough to open a "quick print" shop in a good location. They ended up servicing a larger area than normal because they added the service of pic-up and delivery early in the mornings. After six months of success at each of these businesses they were ready to sit down a look at their overall master plan.</p>

          <p>3. <b>Business Outline</b></p>

          <p>3.1 <b>Topics </b></p>

          <p><b>Planning, Strategy, and Tactics along with Goal Setting and Policy Formulation </b>was where they then focused their efforts. They spent most of their time in looking at markets, by walking around. (Ref. Case Studies Sec. 4.5) They knew they wanted to stay focused on the service industry for a couple of years but they also wanted to expand across the country. After countless days of looking they found a small travel company that was loosing money and jumped at the chance to be bought out. It was sure better than closing the doors. It just happened that it had offices in three of the cities they eventually wanted to market in. (Ref. Case Studies Sec. 4.1,2,3,4 and 5. Business Outline Appendix Sec. 7.)</p>

          <p>After a year of operation they felt it was time to get into retail. They were told about a chain of stores that were up for sale. It was time now to seriously look at the <b>Risks and Rewards of Business Growth and Profitability</b>. They questioned it, but this was also the time that they caused the <b>Transition From Informal to more Formal Methods of Management</b> throughout their entire business.</p>

          <p>3.2 <b>General Divisions</b></p>

          <p>At this time they had about 100 employees in 10 locations and they felt that they never saw each other, or in that manner any friends at all. They decided that it would best to hire a president and a true professional person to run the <b>General Management </b>for them. (Ref. Case Studies Sec. 4.1) This freed Sue up to focus on <b>Marketing </b>(Ref. Case Studies Sec. 4.5) and the acquisition of additional businesses. Kay also hired a professional to take over <b>Management Control </b>(Ref. Case Studies Sec. 4.3) so she could spent more time on <b>Human Aspects of Business.</b> (Ref. Case Studies Sec. 4.2) They were doing about $2MM in yearly sales and each saving about $10k per year at this time so they felt it was time to both spend some time on their personal <b>Financial Management</b>. (Ref. Case Studies Sec. 4.4) The problems that they woke up to every day staggered them. It seemed that every governmental agency was out to get them, they had to take a loan out at a local bank and every time they decided to grow the banker got nervous, all the employees felt that they were underpaid, even though they were all on incentives. The stuff hit the fan when it turned out that an environmental agency fined them for a six digit number because of a mistake on a fire break that changed a mouse’s house. At that time they needed to call on Robert Dilenschneider (Ref. 7. Bus Outline Book list notes) and Roger Fisher (Ref. 7. Bus. Outline Book list Notes). It was some comfort to have read all the biography's of business people over the past few years to feel that they were in good company with the feeling that every step they took forward they had to take a few back.</p>

          <p>Even with all the problems the "Fire Break Service Co.", "Fast Print Now" and "Retail Dress International" grew and remained profitable. The biggest problem Sue and Kay found themselves faced with was communicating and listening to one another. There were a number of times that the E-Mail message did not sound right and one or the other would be mad for days. There were a couple of times that they were ready to call it quits, but they both did not want to hit the unemployment lines. Even though they had professionals running the companies it still took allot of time and energy. After a brief vacation they decided to expand into distribution and manufacturing. It seems that a vendor in Hong Kong made them an offer they could not refuse and at the same time the freight company that he was using wanted to sell. They jumped in with both feet after spending hours going over <b>Decision Analysis</b>, (Ref. Case Studies 4.6) learning as much as they could about <b>Business, Government, and the International Economy </b>(Ref. Case Studies 4.7) and focusing on <b>Creating and Managing International Business Relationships</b>. (Ref. Case Studies 4.8)</p>

          <p>All of a sudden they found themselves running a large international collection of companies. They decided that business was taking so much time that they did not at this time expand to some of the cities they first set their goals on being in. So now they vacation in those cities. On their 29th birthdays they took each other around the world, but to tell you the truth they had seen the inside of so many planes that it was not as much fun as they had thought it would be. The good news is that they are content and have started that non-profit foundation that they first thought about.</p>

          <p><b>Conclusion and Summary</b></p>

          <p>In all aspects of business it is important to keep it as simple as possible because it will get complicated very fast anyway. Also, you will not ever have enough time to solve all the problems so you are better off attempting to keep things as simple as you can. A few simple statements to focus on are the following:</p>

          <p>1. <b>Find the market</b> that is there - do not attempt to create one - it cannot be done.</p>

          <p>2. Do something, learn what happened, <b>learn and improve</b>, and do the something again, and repeat.</p>

          <p>3. Always <b>have a positive cash flow</b>.</p>

          <p>4. Always <b>save for a rainy day</b>, when you do not have a positive cash flow.</p>

          <p>5. Concentrate on cash, profit is secondary.</p>

          <p>6. Four financial statements</p>

          <p>1. One to operate your business - done internally.</p>

          <p>2. One for the bank - done by the CPA.</p>

          <p>3. One for the IRS - done by the CPA.</p>

          <p>4. One in order to <b>build wealth</b> - done by you.</p>
