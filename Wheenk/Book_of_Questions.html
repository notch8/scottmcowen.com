          <p>THE BOOK OF QUESTIONS</p>

          <p>A fellow named Will walked out of one of the major stockbrokerage houses in Manhattan with a check made out to him for over $500M. He had asked them to wire it to his account but they wanted to make a big ceremony over it. He did not like that type of ceremony, but he figured he could indulge them because after all they were the ones who were writing the check and they did spell his name correctly. You might ask how a young man could receive this kind of money legally and not simply inheriting it? In short he did it by looking out for others and helping them make more. He had found that over a short number of years he needed a couple of ingredients to come together. The ingredients were: a wise and experienced man advising him and listening to his frustrations and successes, people who were in need, were coachable, time, and faith. </p>

          <p>Without someone to befriend him and walk with him thorough his tough times he would have never had the vision nor the energy to accomplish what he did. Without the people to work with he could have never done it by himself because there was simply too much to do. He needed a team and a community to work in. Without people that would listen and try his suggestions he would have never had the energy to do all the work himself. Without time he would have not been able to accomplish what he did. And, the most important ingredient that he needed was his faith. He would have not had the vision to accomplish what he did with his unwavering faith.</p>

          <p>He now had to come with ways to invest his newfound fortune. For the past few years he had reinvested most of his earnings into people and their projects. He thought until he could come up with enough new projects to put his money he should put it into real estate or the stock market like most radio talk shows and magazines have encouraged him to do. He had not really given it much thought, but off the top of his head he figured that he might just put it in a very safe bank and wait. He first had to celebrate by calling his mentor and having a good talk and laugh. He also was going to take a trip. He had wondered if what he had done in the United States would apply in foreign countries.</p>

          <p>He knew he would have a language barrier, but he realized cultures are very different and people see the world differently from where they have come from. He thought the safest plan would be to try his system and process in England in order to no have the language problem. He also knew that he would still probably have somewhat of a problem because the English language spoken by the English is significantly different than that spoken in the States. Therefore he shortly made plans to go to London.</p>

          <p>In taking a bit of time to reflect on how he had accomplished what he had over the past few years he figured out that maybe he should write it down so someone else would be able to do the same. The following is that story and reflection.</p>

          <p>Introduction</p>

          <p>This book is an adventure around the world finding meaning and significance.</p>

          <p>The main character is not an CIA operative or a 007 figure, but an ordinary guy looking for what most ordinary people are pursuing; that is asking and getting some answers to the questions: “What is life about, who am I in the I that I talk to and what is my purpose?”</p>

          <p>The adventure takes place in the following places: California, Hawaii, Nevada, New York, Boston, London, Ireland, Paris, Edinburgh, St. Petersburg, Switzerland, Durban, Tanzania, The Emigrants, Israel, Greece, Hong Kong, Tokyo, Beijing, and Christ Church.</p>

          <p>The time is one of uncertainty. There is the threat of terrorism throughout the world and the economies of the world seem to be more fragile than they have been in the past. The reason for this thought is probably because due to modern communication more about the other parts of the world is presented to one every day whereas in the past it would take sometimes years for news to spread and in some cases one would never learn about what was occurring in the far reaches of the world.</p>

          <p>Will Burton was raised in a small town as many American’s were. He was not blessed with exceptional intellect or physical abilities, but he was curious. He did not excel in school but he did ask many questions. He wondered why this or that was the way it was. After high school he ended up going to a public university and received average grades. It wasn’t until after he graduated, worked doing a collection of miscellaneous jobs that he decided to focus on some of his basic questions that he did not have answered in school or by his parents growing up. He had been told as a child to wait until you are an adult to make up your mind what you want to believe when it came to religion. He would ask his parents why things were the way they were, and the answer he would normally get was “because” or “wait until you are older and you will figure it out”.</p>

          <p>Will was six foot three inches tall and an average build. He found that he was taller than most people, but shorter than a few. He did not feel that he stuck out in a crowd until he found himself in certain cultures where the average height of a person was somewhat shorter than that of the United States. He was white, with ethnic ties to England and Scotland. He was fourth generation American and second generation Californian. His youth was spent with many Hispanic and Native American friends. He did not acquire many black friends until his college years and after. He did not think of race as an issue until his adult years when people attempted to tell him that he thought differently about them than he did. He could not understand how they felt that they knew what he thought before they would ask him.</p>

          <p>It was a winter day and Will had just quit his job and decides he was going to spend time in Yosemite Valley, California, “Getting his act together”. One would have thought he was going through a “mid life crisis” but he was only in his early mid life. It was a mild winter but even so it was cold at night in the valley. Will had taken proper camping gear and clothing so he was able to get away from civilization and was self-reliant. He would spend the days hiking, fishing and simply contemplating and the nights bundled up in his tent. He loved the fact that there were not many people there. He would see on the average two people per day, but all in all he was pretty much completely alone. This gave him the time to not only think about the questions that he had been grappling with but also time to attempt to hear that “still quite voice” that was to answer those questions for him. After a few months he was not “getting any answers”. About the time that he was going to move on he ran into an old gentleman on the trail one day named Ian. They walked together for a while and immediately “hit it off”. That evening Will met Ian at his camp and they spent the night talking about all sorts of things. It turns out that Ian had spent countless years thinking things through each year in the wilderness. He felt that the time alone gave him a perspective that he could not get with the busyness of everyday life. Will was impressed. Ian looked like a thin “Santa Clause” or a John Muir, who is quite famous in Yosemite, but when you looked into Ian’s eyes and listened to his stories and perspectives you knew that he understood. He was not a “sage”, but pretty close. </p>

          <p>As time went on Will learned that Ian hid his pots and pans and other cooking utensils in a burlap bag under a certain rock formation in order to save the energy of packing it in each year. Will heard stories of when Ian was a medic during the landing at Normandy. He spoke of it as if it was yesterday. Only one in ten of Ian’s fellow medics made it past that eventful day. He did not talk about it a lot, but Will learned very quickly why Ian’s generation has been labeled “The Greatest Generation”. It turned out that Ian had lived a very active life that Will found that he would like to model. As the days turned to a few months Will came out and ask Ian to ‘be his mentor’. Ian said he did not know what that really meant, but he would certainly be Will’s friend. Ian said if Will would like him to help direct Will’s decisions in order to live a life that Ian understood Will would like to live he would, but they would have to focus and that he expected Will to be coachable, because at 92 years old Ian did not figure that he had much time on this earth to waste. In fact, he pointed out to Will that time is the most precious thing that anyone has at his or her disposal and he did not expect Will to waste time at all. After a number of hours they came to the conclusion to come up with a loose contract that stated that Will would communicate to Ian once per week for the first few months and then monthly after that. Will would have someone to help him focus and accomplish his goals and Ian would have the personal satisfaction of seeing a young man grow and accomplish the goals that they set out together. You see, Will’s goals were not only to have a fulfilled life, but he set a particular timetable and goal on helping others. As a young man he had spent hours praying in attempting to find what he was to do with his life. He had learned as a young man that he was the most content and fulfilled as a human when he was helping others and had shared with Ian that he had desired to help a minimum of a thousand people directly and one million indirectly in his lifetime. Ian found that to be a noble cause and committed to help him the best that he could. </p>

          <p>The first task that they addressed was how to communicate. Ian assured Will that he had access to the internet so they agreed that they would email each other and set up a mutual website for additional communication between themselves and others that they wanted to communicate with. In fact Will has no idea where Ian spends his time. He knows he is in the Sierra’s part of the time, but does not know where he spends the other part of his time. When Will pressed Ian on how can he keep up on his emailing in the wilderness Ian showed him his solar powered system that keeps his satellite phone and laptop continuously charged. As for Will he would many times find an Internet café to work in or the office of someone he was working with. </p>

          <p>Will and Ian had a farewell lunch at the Ahwahnee Lodge dining room. Neither liked the crowds that were attracted to the valley floor in Yosemite, much preferring spending time in the high country but they agreed it was worth putting up with the tourists in order to experience the delightful time spent in the magnificent wood and rock dining room at the Ahwahnee. </p>

          <p>Besides concluding how they would communicate while apart they defined other aspects of how they would work together. You see Will was on a quest to help people. In so doing he was unsure of where he would be going and what exactly he would be doing to help them. Ian pointed out that there were a couple of international languages that one has to have a basic grasp of in order to communicate throughout the world. They are: music, sign language, feelings, faith and accounting. Will was surprised at Ian’s comment about accounting. Ian explained that in the East, Parts of the Ex Soviet Union and Mid East they use a different system for accounting, but in most of the world one can find that accounting is pretty universal. Therefore, it would be imperative that Will at least understand basic accounting. He pointed out it is somewhat like learning basic physics. If you drop a lead ball off a balcony it will go down. If you run a car into a tree it will stop abruptly depending on how fast it is going, how big the car is and how big the tree is. The same” reality rules” apply to everyday interactions between people and organizations. If you take in $100k and give out $120k you are going to be $20k short. Many people get ahead of themselves and figure that the basics do not apply to them, but in the end they apply to all and Ian told Will to memorize of keep a copy of this accounting diagram with him at all times so they can communicate clearly. [Diagram A]</p>

          <p>Ian suggested that Will also deal and learn about the other universal languages, but emphasized that he understood that they would take longer to grasp, probably his entire lifetime. The two that he suggested focusing on first were Will’s faith and his feelings. Will found that strange because Ian had been talking about something so black and white as accounting and they switched so quickly to faith and feelings, which are so utterly subjective. Ian pointed out that just because they are subjective does not make them less real that the basic laws of physics. He emphasized that Will should be able to define his feelings and clarify his faith because if he wants to accomplish what he has defined he will need all the clarity and understanding that he can draw on. With these subjects simply touched upon they said their “good bys” but understood that even though they would be physically separated that they would remain close by constant communication. </p>

          <p>Will headed to the Fresno Airport on this way to Santa Fe, New Mexico. </p>

          <p>Upon his arrival in Santa Fe Will’s first encounter was with an American Indian woman who was selling silver jewelry near the town square. It was her kind face that attracted his attention, particularly her eyes. The statement “one’s eyes are the window to one’s soul” was true in her case. Will could tell she was different. She was kind, gentle and warm but had had a hard life. She was sitting on a rug selling her jewelry and did not look very busy so he ask if he could sit down and lean against the wall and talk until she was busy. She welcomed him. She name is Ruth. She said that her given name was always mispronounced therefore she responded to Ruth as a young woman and it stuck. Her story was one of a survivor. She was born on an Indian reservation in South Dakota but when gold was discovered she was moved as a small child to Oklahoma. Her parents died at that time. When she felt that she was getting her feet on the ground oil was discovered on their reservation and she was moved to New Mexico. In order to survive she learned how to make silver and turquoise jewelry and weave blankets. Her entire adult life was spent focused on these two activities. She lived in a one-room house. She developed a couple of chronic medical problems as a child therefore her life was spent surviving, not with a particularly high quality of life. She worked hard and in any of her free time she would take care of neighbor children who’s parents were unable to take care of the for one reason or another. Her survival was harder the last few years because she found that outsiders were importing jewelry and rugs into her area that were make in India and China. She could not understand how they could make them so cheaply. After a few hours Ruth stopped and said that she could not believe that she had told Will so much. She said that she normally is pretty quit and keeps to herself. Will ask if he could see her the next day. She said fine. Things were pretty slow and she would be at the same place at the same time. She had been doing the same thing for some twenty years.</p>

          <p>Will spent the evening thinking about Ruth’s plight. He then summarized his thoughts and sent a note of to Ian asking for ideas. Ian happen to be at this computer so they had exchanges with thoughts and strategies that Ruth may be able to use. The next day Will returned and spoke with Ruth about some of the ideas. They seemed so simple, straightforward that she wondered why she did not think of them and she said she would give some of them a try. The suggested strategy was to realize that she did not have the best retail location and that she also was not a good salesperson, but an outstanding artist. She was wasting her time having tourists attempt to have her original works sold for less because they had no idea the quality of her products. Will suggested that he would help represent and introduce her to a few “high end” art galleries in Santa Fe and New York. He acted as her agent and sold her works to others while she was unable to get enough courage to do so herself. He then went to her house and helped her organize her work space so that she would be more effective, arranged an air freight company to deliver and pick up her art work to be shipped, set her up on a computer system in order that she would be able to communicate to the galleries and himself. She notified the people that she was renting her “retail space”, the ten by five foot area on the sidewalk that she would no longer need to rent the space. The hardest change that she was to make which Will insisted upon was to focus on creating only one piece of jewelry and one unique rug per month. She was to also raise the prices of each by ten times. She was use to making a countless variety of pieces that tended to blend into look like “all the rest of the tourist trinkets”. This differentiation was difficult for Ruth to accept but she felt that she would give it a try. She was nervous and in fact a bit embarrassed but by this time she trusted Will’s suggestions and she felt that she really did not have that much to loose, even though the change put some of her pieces selling in the galleries in the thousands of dollars instead of the ten’s of dollars she was use to. [Concept A]</p>

          <p>After a month Will found that he had to leave for New York in order to promote Ruth’s work there. He had set her up with a basic accounting system and set up a business service to help her with her day-to-day accounting and then hit the road. </p>

          <p>Upon arriving in New York Will found the first hostel that he could. His budget was very tight and in fact he thought that she would have to take a part time job until he hoped he could establish Ruth’s artwork in a few galleries. Every gallery that he approached would only put her work on consignment to start with. They would tell him that after the merchandise would prove itself they would then pay him cash, but until that time they would only pay for it when it sold. Fortunately Ruth had a number of pieces that she had created over the years that she had “laying around” her house and small barn. It turns out that when she blew the dust off of some of the pieces she came up with over one hundred pieces of fine jewelry and fifty or so rugs. Will let her know to dust it all off and send seventy five pieces of jewelry and thirty rugs to galleries that he made contacts with. They had already put pieces in galleries in Santa Fe that had sold a few but it was still to early to tell if they were going to have a success or were simply going to “just get by”. That is why Will suggested to Ruth to put together three scenarios. [Concept B]</p>

          <p>He wanted her to be ready to face any of number of problems with her financial condition in the future. Since she was “up in years” he wanted her to be in the safest financial position that she could but if it did not go well he wanted her to be ready to cut back. That was really not hard for her because she had never had any money so anything was better than she was use to. Ruth and Will had an agreement that he would get a percentage of the sales of all her work. But since the galleries were insisting on the consignment arrangements he would not receive any income until the merchandise sold. It was a few long weeks in New York. He was questioning if he had done right by Ruth encouraging her to market her wares as art work that it was or should she go back to that five by ten small piece of real estate and sell to the tourists?</p>

          <p>Time answered that question for him; and not that much at that. Five of the galleries that Will convinced to try Ruth’s work and one in Santa Fe sold all of their merchandise and begged for more. This caused Ruth to talk to a couple of her friends to help her work on new rugs and in fact she ask for a few of the rugs that she had given to friends to let her have them back and she would make them some more in the future. All in all Ruth became very wealthy in a few short weeks. He put more money in her bank in one month than she had in her entire life to that point. She could not believe it. She very shortly set up a fund to send some of the local students. To date she has paid the full tuition for some hundred and fifty students. And that is not all. She has been able to set up playgrounds and back yard basketball hoops for many of the younger children within a five hundred mile radius of where she lives. She has chosen not to move, but she does have a retirement fund that has guaranteed her a livable income for the next twenty years. Will has come out well also. He has a nice income as long as Ruth creates new artwork. </p>

          <p>Upon arriving in London Will first made the rounds to the tourist sites. He found that one of his favorite places was the small dinning room in the Tate Museum. He was not an art expert, but he did enjoy art and knew what he liked. One day he could not help ease dropping on a conversation occurring between a couple that was sitting next to him. It seemed that the fellow was telling his wife that they were about to loose the newspaper that her father had left them upon the father’s death. They were not only to make an income on this newspaper for themselves, but were to furnish some five hundred people employment and an income for her mother and sister who was stricken with a rare disease. The husband by the end of their meal was in tears as well as the wife. They were praying and already treating the financial situation that they were in as if it was a terminal case.</p>

          <p>Will risk announcing that he could not help overhearing their conversation and that he would like to help them if he could and if they would let him. After a short conversation they said that they would welcome any help they could get. They said that it was pretty much a lost cause, but they appreciated anything he had to say. He told them that he would like to meet them in their office for half a day and after that time he would know if he felt that he could help and they would be able to make the decision to retain him or not. They said fine. They figured, what do we have to loose? They gave him the address of the family office. It seemed that the newspaper operation was in a large building on the edge of London, but the family had a number of other small businesses so they kept an executive office right around the corner from the department store Harrods. </p>

          <p>Will arrived at eight the next morning. He found a staff of about ten people and they were all very sober. It turns out that the previous evening the couple returned from the Tate to announce that they would probably close the doors in two weeks because of the fact that their major bank was expecting payments that they were unable to come up with. </p>

          <p>Will found that the gentleman’s name was Robert and his wife name was Mary. Will did not waste any time before attempting to get a feel of what was going on. [Three investigation and planning steps that can be found on the Net at Wheek.com] He found that Mary’s father had started the newspaper following World War II. It started slowly but over the past fifty plus years it grew into a pretty significant concern. The tragedy of Mary’s father’s untimely death occurred six years previously. Robert had attended on of the Oxford Universities and had come to work with his father-in-law about ten years ago. He spent most of his time in writing a couple of columns and limited amount of time in administration but the family and a few minority owners felt that he should be the one to take Mary’s father’s place. All worked well for the first five years. In fact, they had become even more profitable and had expanded at a rate of fifteen percent per year so all thought all was well. The problem that occurred this past year was that the economy softened and the advertising revenue had dropped off somewhat. It was not an amount that was alarming, but at the same time expenses increased and they had found that they lost some one hundred thousand pounds per month for the past year. What had brought this cash emergency on was that their bank noticed the cash outflow and they felt that they had better “pull the plug” before they were put in a position of loosing anything. There were currently plenty of assets that covered the bank, but they were unsure if that would last very long so they decided to call the loan. </p>

          <p>By lunchtime Will felt that he understood the situation pretty well. He had never encountered a similar problem, but he got a hold of his friend Ian and he also went over a couple of points that they had put on the Web to help them “roll play” a few situations and by the next morning Will was ready to meet with Robert and Mary privately. The meeting was very emotional. To see all of their employees loose their jobs plus their extended family who were dependent on the income for their well being Robert and Mary saw the situation as a death. In fact, the termination of the business brought many feelings of Mary’s father’s death back to the surface for each of them. They felt angry, sad, scared, afraid, confused ashamed and lonely all at the same time. </p>

          <p>The suggestion by Will to them was that he would work behind the scenes for one year. They would pay him a nominal amount, but he wanted a contract that he would be paid in one lump sum all income over five hundred thousand pounds income for the next year. Following that first year he would be paid three percent of the net income and would be expected to monitor the financial results on a yearly basis for the next five years. Since they had lost over a million pounds the last ten months and were about to loose everything they owned they felt that this agreement was most fair. After a few days of thought Will returned to give them the main points that he was going to insist that they implement. The two main changes were to reduce the number of reporters that they had and to reduce the amount of inventory they kept on hand of raw newsprint paper which came in large rolls. There were certainly a number of other changes but these two were going to make the largest impact and he wanted them implemented in the next few days. The first issue was the number of reporters that would have to be laid off. He pointed out that they currently had thirty-five reporters and he felt that they would have to reduce that number to seven. Robert insisted that would be impossible. Will’s response was to state that they could then go to three. Robert said. “How in the world could we report the news? We are a newspaper and that is what we sell. We need all the reporters we currently have. We have already reduced the amount to thirty-seven from the fifty we once had. A reduction to seven is or three is impossible. How would we report the news?” Will’s response, “Have the three watch BBC the night before!” After a few minutes of heated debate they agreed upon the amount of seven. Will, Robert and Mary then went to the production plant and walked out on the floor and told the production manager to reduce the inventory from a forty day lead time to a three day lead time. Again Will heard all the reasons why they could not do that. It was not quite as headed an argument that he heard from Robert about the reporter reduction but when the plant manager heard the statement: “Well, you really don’t have to reduce the inventory because in a few days the bank is going to foreclose on the entire operation and they will do it at that time.”</p>

          <p>The next few days were very difficult for both Robert and Mary. It was certainly not an easy task to let reporters go who had been there for a number of years. But in fact out of the twenty eight that left eight took retirement that the funds were already in place for them, Robert arranged to have five get jobs at other newspapers and the remaining five ended up thanking him in a year or so because they went on to what they felt was more rewarding careers. Two published books and the remaining three became business owners.</p>

          <p>Needless to say there was not a delivery of newsprint for almost an entire month. The supplier kept calling assuming that they were going out of business but since he had already put them on a cash basis because he was worried about getting paid a year or so before he was not that concerned. </p>

          <p>Six weeks later Robert, Mary and Will had a meeting with their bank. At the start of the meeting Robert presented the bank with a check for the amount of four million pounds. That amount was about eighty percent of the total amount that was owed to the bank. They then presented the bank with a three-year projection that demonstrated that if they met their realistic projections they would make one and a half million pounds over the next year. This drastic improvement was not just because of the cuts in the reporters but as the others in the organization saw that Robert and Mary really meant what they were saying for a year or so about cutbacks there were a number of cutbacks that the operational and line people came up themselves that truly helped the financial improvement of the entire operation. In fact after a short six weeks Robert and Mary could not remember when the moral and attitude of the entire operation had been better. By the end of the meeting with the bank, which only lasted for an hour and a half the loan officer had brought in a couple of other executives and they were attempting to loan the newspaper more money. The old adage that you could only borrow money when you did not need it became a reality to Robert and Mary.</p>

          <p>Will spent minimal time with Robert and Mary after the cuts were made and the plan was in place. They took charge of the operation and in fact even though they had three scenarios they exceeded the most optimistic one each period. [Note reasons for scenario planning in appendix and Web site.] As you might have noted in the description of the bank meeting Will’s income for the next year was over a million pounds for the first year and some one hundred thousand pounds for the next five years until his agreement with the newspaper expired. Robert and Mary were very pleased because if you remember if Will was going to make money that meant Robert and Mary made out very well. They all three became very close friends and get together as much as they can socially when time and distance allows it.</p>

          <p>Will used London as his home base for a year or so. He would spend time traveling to most of the major cities in Europe and some of the smaller ones. His favorite turner out to be Zermatt, Switerland. He would go there weeks at a time to hike and simply soak in the environment. The fact that there were many tourists did not bother him because in a short amount of time he could hike to places that were essentially deserted.</p>

          <p>One even when he was eating in a restaurant that had fun music on the main walking street he struck up with a young lady that was seating at the table next to him. She was attractive but the two main attractions that he really noticed were her smile and the twinkle in her eyes. In fact he found it hard to keep his eyes off of her. About half way through his meal he finally ask if he could join her. She said, “sure”. It turned out that she was sent on a short vacation because her boss was very pleased with a project that she had spent a year putting together. Will found out that her name was Dora and she had been in Europe for five years doing pretty much what he was doing, but with the advertising and art side of businesses. She would help companies with their projected images, particularly to consumers in the United States. She had spent the last few years with Nestle. When she was not working with companies that were profit oriented she would spend her free time helping non-profit businesses improve their images. She had found that the needs in the world were great and she pretty much focused on European non-profits that were working to relieve the suffering of poverty and Aids in Africa. Will was very impressed and noted that he may not marry her but they would be good friends for a long time. He did not believe in “love at first sight”, but Dora’s smile, bright eyes, brain and big heart impressed him very much. They ended up talking for just about the entire night and ended up hiking together the next day. After a few more days Dora had to return to Geneva where she worked. One bit of information that stuck out to Will that he learned from Dora over the past few days was that she knew of a company that was very large but since there had been a shift in the world economy that effected its industry it had fallen on hard times and they could probably use someone like him. The problem was that it was in Hong Kong. He had never been there and knew that he was falling in love with the Alps and also he did not want to be very far from Dora. But, what she had told him seemed to be right up his ally so he arranged to communicate with the majority owner of the organization.</p>

          <p>By doing his research he learned that the company, Orbit Packaging, was a public owned company that at one time furnished the packing products for the majority of products exported from Hong Kong. With the explosion of Chinese manufacturing the company grew very fast and large. But as many other packaging companies were organized and other regions in China grew they found that the margins shrunk even though the volume seemed to keep growing. Will found that they were a very large company with well over one hundred thousand employees. He was introduced to the majority owner, who did not run the company day to day but who controlled it, by a contact that Dora had. He flew into Hong Kong and was picked up at the airport by the owner’s private car. His name was Mr. Yee, but he goes by simply Yee. Even though Will had spent the last few months in Switzerland, which is certainly not a third world country, he felt that the standard of living he experience at he Hong Kong airport amazed him. It seems that while looking for Yee’s car he could only see Rolls Royces, Bentleys, high end BMW’s and Mercedes. The driver of Yee’s car was very apologetic that he did not meet him at the gate, but since Will’s plane arrived early the driver did not have a chance to get there in time.</p>

          <p>Will had been to New York and other large cities but he was over whelmed at the height of the building that he was taken to in downtown Hong Kong. He was pleasantly surprised at how fun Yee seemed. One could tell that he was very energetic, bright, while at the same time he seemed humble. He had created this huge empire but he seemed so open minded. He listened very intently to everything that was said. Will knew that he heard every word and when he did not understand something he would admit it and ask for more information in order to allow him to truly understand each issue that they discussed. After their initial meeting Will needed rest and they set a time the next day to go over the main issues. </p>

          <p>In a short time the next morning Will understood the essence of the issues Yee was faced with. What he did have trouble getting his mind around was the magnitude of the numbers. Their volumes of sales were in the multi billions of dollars. He would have to ignore the zeros behind each number that Yee would show him. He had not seen the concepts work on a company this large, but he simply had never had an opportunity to even imagine working with a company this size before. After a short meeting it was concluded that Will would receive ten percent of the next income from the company after one year. In the mean time he would be paid a very generous retainer and the use of all the companies private jets, cars, boats, vacation villa’s and just about anything else Will could imagine. He did not come up with this payment plan. Yee did. But he gladly agreed and signed a contract on the spot. He felt very good that he felt that he really did not need a contract because he was already feeling connected with Yee.</p>

          <p>The next morning Yee explained to Will the overall situation. Will felt that he got the “big picture” in a few hours. He was still amazed at the size of the employee base and the revenue. It turns out that the old saying, “The bigger they are the bigger they fall” certainly applied in this case. It turns out that the industry had shifted and Yee’s organization had not adapted quick enough. They all felt that things would get better on their own. “The market will come back like it always does”, was constantly been said throughout their organization. </p>

          <p>After a day or so Will sat down with Yee with a strategy and plan. He had ask Yee how many and who were the competition that Orbit had directly. He had found that there were seven major players in their specific market nitch. Orbit had lost billions of dollars the last few years and Yee and Will knew that Orbit would not last much longer at that rate. The plan was to find out which of the competition would like to sell out. When Yee heard that he said, “I will not be able to buy anyone with the financial position that I am currently in”. Will told him to not concern himself with that at this time but to find one of the seven that would agree. It took Yee some time to report back to Will, but since Yee was so predominate in the industry everyone knew him and he had a meeting with each of the competition. Yee’s report to Will was that there was a particular company that had also lost significant amounts of money the last few years and they would be interested in selling. A couple of the companies were doing very good and they did not want to sell. A few others were doing OK but they said they would have to get all their owners together and it would be a long, hard time consuming proposition. </p>

          <p>Will then called Ian who had a relationship with a large brokerage house in New York. He then arranged that Yee would meet them and borrow enough money for a short term to buy to company. The brokerage house would end up with a small percentage of equity, their loan paid back, and a very high interest rate on their short-term loan so they agreed to the deal very quickly. Yee was surprised, but ended up going along with Will’s plan which caused them to buy the other company, move all their customers to Orbit’s plants and operate them twenty four hours per day, finance seventy percent of the buy-out with the seller, sell off the equipment to pay off the down payment, sell off the building and land to put a few billion dollars of “safety cash” in the bank. This event took six months to accomplish, but Yee had the energy, contacts and will to have the entire deal wrapped up in that time period. </p>

          <p>That takes us to Will walking out of the brokerage house with a mere $500M check in his breast pocket. His next issue to deal with was what to do with his newfound wealth. He knew he to be a good steward of all that he had, because God only loaned what he had to him. The first project took him to Tanzania, East Africa. A city had all of a sudden become overrun with starving people because of a drought. The normal rainfall in the region was some ten inches per year, but for the last five years there was only an average of one inch per year. In fact, for the past eighteen months there had been no rain at all. This caused an influx of one hundred thousand people to flee to the city of five hundred thousand people. Not only did they not have places to live, they had no jobs or any way to feed themselves or their families. In a few short months there was a crisis.</p>

          <p>Will flew into the city of Arusha. He had never been to a third world country. In fact, he realized he had really had never spent any real time in a second world country. The poverty hit him real hard. He was not use to the dust, smells, street kids begging, random traffic, and overall indiscriminate feeling of chaos. He knew he was going to need help, but first he was going to need information. Where could he start? He was afraid to go to the normal large relief organizations because he questioned their effectiveness. He had heard his entire adult life how much many of the charity organizations spent in third world countries without real accomplishments. With all the money spent, his question was why was the problems still so very great? But when he learned that there were probably two hundred thousand of the five hundred thousand people in this one city that were virtually homeless and jobless he realized that even his new found wealth would not last very long attempting to house and feed all of them. The children who had their hands out begging for food, or any help at all, that were everyplace that he went in the city particularly caught his attention. Their big eyes seemed to look right into his soul.</p>

          <p>After a few days of walking around and observing the best he could he went to a relief agency that was already set up. It did not take him long to find that they really did not want his input, but simply his money. They made it clear that they knew what was best for “the native people” and he could write a check to them, but they really did not want additional input from him. This confused him but also caused him to become angry. They made it real clear to him that they felt that they knew best how to spend his money and they did not want to debate it. There was one gentleman who overheard Will speaking to the general director that caught up with Will as he was walking away from the office. His name was Osyma and he explained that he overheard his concern and offered to be of any help that he could. After a couple of additional meetings with Osyma Will found himself at the local tavern which seemed to be “the end spot”. It seems that much of the information that would go around the city would not be printed in the paper, because there was only one paper that pretty much was run by the government, but would be communicated and debated in this particular tavern. The debates would start about noon each day and go on till the wee hours of the night. After to many drinks some of the debaters would start fighting. Will did what he could to stay out of the way and it was very difficult for him because he did not understand their language at all. Osyma would help him understand the issues, but many of the issues were complicated and debated with passion.</p>

          <p>After two months of “hanging out” and listening at the tavern Will came up with a plan. He felt the most pressing issues were: first, housing and food, next health care, then education, and security. To complicate the issue the HIV/Aids virus was running unchecked in the region. Will was overwhelmed. He never would have guessed the problems could be so great. The first step that he took was to ask Osyma to work for him full time and have him hire ten of his trusted friends that he felt also had a passion to help solve some of the social and economic problems in the city. They then defined a particular geographic area that was a suburb of the city and had a population of about ten thousand people.</p>

          <p>The ten selected friends were broken up into five teams. The first two people were to start a small construction company. The region was not use to cooperating with one another in building housing. Each family was pretty much left to themselves to build their house so working together to build buildings to live in was unique. With some seed money from Will the company was building two types of structures within a short period of time. The first was an apartment-condo type building that would house ten families and the other was a building that was a very small house that an individual family would live in. After they build five of each type they were completing ten of each per month. These structures were not the type of building that Will was use to living in, but they were much better than ninety per cent of anything in the region.</p>

          <p>The next team started an exporting company. They would go through out the region and buy wood carvings of native animals sell them to the galleries that Will had already made the contacts with in New York city selling jewelry and Native American Indian rugs. Needless to say, the wood carvings were not the normal ones you would find in the average import shop but very artistic large one of a kind art pieces. </p>
