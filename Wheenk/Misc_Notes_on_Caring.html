          </ol><p>-What is your first memory of death loss? When? What do you remember the most?</p>

          <p>-The age at which you think you will die is…that means you really have _____number of years left.</p>

          <p>-When you think about your own death, what scares you the most is…</p>

          <ol start="2" type="1"><li>Reduce anxiety by making a commitment to truthfulness</li>
          </ol><p>-Do not lie to children!</p>

          <p>-Truthfulness reduces anxiety with children.</p>

          <p>-Children who were lied to were worse off when told white lies about death.</p>

          <p>-Do not hide the truth from a child.</p>

          <p>-Children will learn somewhere else the truth.</p>

          <p>-By lying you loose credibility with the children.</p>

          <p>-They can take the truth better than white lies.</p>

          <p>-A child kept uninformed about something so import to him is likely to draw conclusions that are wrong. Children need to know they will not be kept in the dark.</p>

          <p>-Kids thrive with daily routines.</p>

          <p>-Keep kids out of school for about 3-5 days @ death.</p>

          <ol start="4" type="1"><li>Become models for healthy expression of loss issues</li>
          </ol><p>-Let the parents cry. Explain why you are crying. Sad or happy? Do not hide grief from children.</p>

          <p>-Share to normalize the experience. Model healthy grief.</p>

          <p>-Suggest writing about grief instead of talking about it with teens.</p>

          <p>-A child’s quote when ask why he is acting up: “I am Sad so I am Mad so I am Bad!”</p>

          <ol start="5" type="1"><li>Create memories to aid positive recall</li>
          </ol><p>-Scrapbook with dying person.</p>

          <p>-Record stories with video and recorder, make collages, etc.</p>

          <p>-Starting collections together, (stamps from an era, coins, etc.</p>

          <p>-Giving meaningful gifts. (For example, a favorite rocking chair, jewelry, etc.) Give the treasured things away while you are alive.</p>

          <p>-“Just because you are dying does not mean that you are dead.”</p>

          <p>-Ask the dying person if, “there are any unfinished tasks?”*****</p>

          <ol start="6" type="1"><li>Discover and create opportunities for inclusion</li>

          <p>-Children are traumatized when they are excluded.</p>

          <p>-“I need to get x &amp; take it in, would you help me?” would be appropriate.</p>

          <p>-Children absorb anxiety that they pick up in the room like a sponge.</p>

          <p>-When people cannot find words to say they create rituals. Ex. Is people walking by Reagan’s coffin.</p>

          <p>-Find ways to include children. Ex. Sing, “Jesus loves me.”</p>

          <ol start="7" type="1"><li>Seize everyday moments for teaching opportunities.</li>
          </ol><p>-Have children read children books about death and talk about them.</p>

          <p>-Take children to funerals that are people who they are not close to.</p>

          <ol start="8" type="1"><li>Link up with others to provide broad-spectrum care.</li>

          <h1>What to Say and What Not to Say to the Grieving</h1>

          <p>Shortened Article by Dr. James R. Kok</p>

          <p>There are times when well-intentioned people do not say appropriate things to people who are grieving. For example, an unacceptable sentence is, “<i>All things work together for good to those who love God.”</i> You may say this to yourself as needed, but usually when it is quoted to another, it is inappropriate. Why? When given to a friend, it is usually when a harsh blow of some kind has hurt them. Often it is the death of a loved one, but it could be any unwanted loss, change or misfortune. It is true that most of the good stuff in life trickles out of heartache, breakage, disappointment and loss. God does arouse, inspire and teach those who are devastated, often with positive results. This does occur most of the time-but not always. A great deal of the tragedy of this world is wasted and good for nothing. It never evolves or turns into anything good.</p>

          <p>Even if true, however, saying “all things work together for good…” to someone who has just been hit by a freight train is the essence of bad timing and a totally wrong way to help a hurting person.</p>

          <p>Another example of good intentions, poorly expressed: In talking with a young mother whose six-year-old daughter died a month earlier said that person after person said <i>“Well, she’s better off now because of her disabilities that she had.</i>” No one can realize how deeply this mom loved that little girl and what an empty place there now is in her life. All that the friends saw was the girl’s disability and the enormous effort it took to care for the child. They saw nothing but relief; whereas the mother was feeling devastated a losing her child. Their words, “Well, she is better off now;” carried the message that she the mom, shouldn’t feel so terrible because the child was now made whole and happy. They projected themselves into the situation and saw only enormous hours of hard work. They failed to see a mother deeply invested in her child, now empty-handed and sorrowing, because her child has died. </p>

          <p>A third unacceptable sentence is, <i>“We must remember, it was the Lord’s will.”</i> The accuracy of those words is not the issue. That is, some may, others may not, believe the death of a child, for instance, is the Lord’s will. Either way, in the face of anguish, this formula does not fit. They do not need theology – they need compassion and understanding. They need acceptance of their tears, along with openness and empathy for their heartache. Telling someone, <i>“It is the Lord’s will,”</i> is another effort to have the hurting person stop feeling so badly. The logic here is that if it is the Lord’s will, it must be good. It can’t be sheer tragedy. It must be seen in some kind of positive light, not with weeping and groaning. These words are always used in an attempt to cheer the broken-hearted or at least to help them put a positive spin on a tragedy. This is not the best way to help them. If we change our thinking about grief, we can drop all such expressions from our attempts to help. Here are some basic thoughts.</p>

          <ol start="1" type="1"><li>God created tears. They should not be blocked, stopped or discouraged. Never should we say to anyone directly or indirectly, “Stop crying.” Tears are good. They should be allowed and encouraged – not dried.</li>
          <li>Each of us must gain the capacity to stand with a crying person and feel the lousy feelings we get when tears are flowing, without trying to get the person to stop crying. It is better to cry with them than to find ways to dry their tears.</li>
          <li>Crying always will come to an end.</li>
          <li>The healing of broken hearts takes time, but God always heals the broken-hearted. We can’t heal them, but God will in His time.</li>
          </ol><p>Stand by. Be there! Walk with them. Offer touch and hugs. Say little. Avoid fixing – God will take care of that.</p>

          <h1>What is good to say?</h1>

          <p><i>“It hurts to lose a Mother.”</i> Or, <i>“This is so terribly sad.”</i> Or, <i>“Go ahead and cry. It is good to cry.”</i> Or, perhaps it is better to not say anything – just hold the person, or sit and listen actively. It doesn’t hurt to ask the obvious question, <i>“How are you feeling?</i>” <b>But it is better to make a statement than to ask a question.</b> Putting it this way may be more suitable; <i>“You must be feeling smashed.”</i> Or, <i>“Your heart must be in total anguish,”</i> I find myself often saying, in the face of a death, “This is so unreal!” “It just doesn’t seem possible.”</p>

          <h1>Show Up and leave the fixing to God</h1>

          <p>Most of our clichés and well-intentioned words are all about fixing. If God’s people would stop trying to fix everybody and leave it to God when a heart is broken, healing would happen in a more timely fashion.</p>

          <p>Show up, but leave the fixing to God. The reason it is hard to stop fixing is that it means sitting in helplessness. We can replace, renew, and repair most broken things in life. Most of the time, when we face a difficulty, we can figure out a solution or a substitute. So we usually slip into that mode in the face of death, but it never fits. <b>We must accept our helplessness.</b> That is hard. We must do our part of being there. But, most of all, we leave the loved ones in the hands of God.</p>

          <h2>Helping People In Life’s Losses</h2>

          <p>Bill Hoy</p>

          <h1>Myths: Releasing Us From the Ties That Bind</h1>

          <p>Grief is a five-state process, and everyone more-or-less works through those stages</p>

          <p>A caregiver who “can’t keep his/her composure” when around a grieving person will only depress them more.</p>

          <p>A grieving person needs to be kept busy so he/she doesn’t think about it so much</p>

          <p>Most young adults in our culture have never experienced real grief</p>

          <p>People with a staunch religious faith don’t really grieve since they know they will see their loved ones again</p>

          <p>Grief, in its normal form, lasts from two weeks to two months.</p>

          <p>A grieving person almost always appreciates your words of comfort such as “I know just how you feel” and “he’s so much better off after suffering so long.”</p>

          <p>It’s best not to mention a loved one’s name or bring up the subject of the loss since it usually just upsets the grieving person all over again.</p>

          <p>Young children don’t really grieve since they are incapable of comprehending the finality of the loss.</p>

          <p>Grief is much “softer” for parents when a baby dies since they didn’t have so long to get attached.</p>

          <h2>Finding Direction In Your Grief</h2>

          <p>Remember</p>

          <p>Reviewing the loved person’s life and my relationship with him/her (Live Review)</p>

          <p><br />
          </p>

          <p>Reaffirm</p>

          <p>Discovering the spiritual values that provide an anchor in loss</p>

          <p>Realize Coming to terms with the reality of the death and the unmitigated pain of loss</p>

          <p>Release</p>

          <p>Saying goodbye to physical presence and moving into a new future without the deceased</p>

          <p>“When the chips are down we look up.”</p>

          <h2>What Do I Do? Looking for Ways to Help</h2>

          <p>Be There</p>

          <p>Don’t ask, do!</p>

          <p>Encourage ceremonies</p>

          <p>Keep on remembering</p>

          <p>Holidays</p>

          <p>Anniversaries </p>

          <p> Weddings</p>

          <p> Birthdays</p>

          <p>Anticipated Events</p>

          <p> High School Grad</p>

          <p> Cruises</p>

          <p>Provide extra help when needed</p>

          <p>Referrals</p>

          <h2>Avoiding the “Dumbs” – Discovering Words That Help</h2>

          <p>Be willing to express your feelings, too </p>

          <p>“Knit your hearts together.”</p>

          <p>Never minimize the griever’s experience</p>

          <p>Not: “I know just how you feel”, “It will get easier each day”</p>

          <p>Truth is: 2<sup>nd</sup> six months is harder than the 1<sup>st</sup> but the 3<sup>rd</sup> is the best of them.</p>

          <p>Give hones, simple answers to children</p>

          <p>Tell children the truth. They can deal with truth better than being deceived.</p>

          <p>Don’t explain, justify, rationalize, or defend God.</p>
