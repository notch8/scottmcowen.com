          <h1>Been</h1>

          <ol start="1" type="1"><li>Born in Long Beach, California, raised from age of 7 in San Jacinto, CA on a small farm. Graduated from UCI, Seminary of the West, HBS-OPM program.</li>
          </ol> <ol start="2" type="1"><li>Married and have raised two daughters and currently have four grandchildren from 1 to 7 years of age.</li>
          </ol> <ol start="3" type="1"><li>Founded or bought 20+ businesses from exporting to Russia, Latvia, &amp; Estonia to Bookshop-Café, Mobile Home Park, Shopping Center, Internet businesses of sheet-music, Natural Novelties, and Netroleum, but mainly retail and wholesale petroleum marketing, (Gasoline, Diesel and lubricants) in Southern California. The SOCO Group in Carlsbad, California is the company.</li>
          </ol> <ol start="4" type="1"><li>Twenty years ago brought in professional management, went back to school and worked as a hospital chaplain, St. Joseph’s, Mission and Saddleback Hospitals.</li>
          </ol> <ol start="5" type="1"><li>Have worked past 8 years as a chaplain to people in business that have lost a spouse to death, financial downturn or other major loss. I listen, understand and brainstorm. Examples: Three girls under 11 years of age in unrelated situations died the first weekend I was on call, time spent with a single mothers who’s young marine son was in a coma for 6 months, two men who died and they brought them back to life after some time, having someone tell their stories is healing, an older gentleman lost his wife to cancer and I was encouraging him to tell me some stories, when I ask for the most “fun time” he thought for what seemed to be 15 minutes, but it was a few long minutes and then he said, “I’m sorry, I can’t do that. I could practically read his mind and saw the most healing in a short period of time that I have ever seen with anyone. My strength as a chaplain is my weakness – I over identify therefore I become very close to the situation, but it is very hard on me. I can help people put money issues in perspective when dealing with so much death, even though many money situations can lead to bad health and even death through suicide and stress.</li>
          </ol> <h1>Am</h1>

          <ol start="6" type="1"><li>I monitor our business and am still on the majority of the debt.</li>
          </ol> <ol start="7" type="1"><li>Current sales $1.5M per day with some 200+ employees, 30 c-stores, bulk plants and office building in five Southern California Counties. EBITDA $6.7 – Goal $10M and fund $5M per year.</li>
          </ol> <ol start="8" type="1"><li>The SOCO Group – convenience stores, bob tails trucks, truck and trailer transports, cardlocks, fleet cards, Wheenk – chaplain/coach/mentor – listen – understand and brainstorm &amp; The SOCO Institute – education, health care &amp; economic empowerment – (Relief &amp; social justice in certain cases)</li>
          </ol> <ol start="9" type="1"><li>Founded The SOCO Institute. The mission is to help educate, provide health care and economic empowerment to people in the majority world by working with existing organizations. </li>
          </ol> <ol start="10" type="1"><li>Find the passions and concerns of The SOCO Group associates and help fund them. An example of this is to give each associate $100 and have them report back after 6 months what they did with the $100 and if it grew.</li>
          </ol> <ol start="11" type="1"><li>Communicate irregularly with 200+ people as chaplain/coach/mentor in business and schools.</li>
          </ol> <ol start="12" type="1"><li>Fund projects with Rescue Task Force, Tropical Health Alliance Foundation, Boys and Girls Club, etc. Examples: Afghan Schools for girls and women literacy and start up commerce, Health clinics on Mosquito Coast in Honduras, Boys and Girls Club scholarships for staff members going to college, </li>
          </ol> <h1>Hope To Be</h1>

          <ol start="13" type="1"><li> Funding $5M per year to affect 10M lives. In addition affect associates and their families lives in a positive way – 800+ and 500+ Wheenk clients. Examples of organizations are: Young Life International Three Cups of Tea – Greg Mortenson, Braille Without Borders, Free Wheelchair Mission, India project for people who are in the untouchable class, Street children in Mexico, Nurse in Ethiopia, on line loans via Opportunity International Connect Web Site, </li>
          </ol> <ol start="14" type="1"><li>A “to be” list – not simply a “to do” list</li>
          </ol> <ol start="15" type="1"><li>What I have Learned – It is hard to give money away, major reason for suicide – tooth aces, bad crops – suicide – clean water, major problem, women in the majority world do most of the work – men very little, # one killer in Africa is babies – childbirth, Majority World economic and social situations have improved over the last twenty years substantially accept for some hot spots, etc.</li>
          </ol> <ol start="16" type="1"><li>Overall – attempt to take my education and experience and leverage to help the most number of people enjoy a better life.</li>
          </ol> <ol start="17" type="1"><li>The more you give the more you receive. Examples, calling on home bound people and listen to their stories. You will learn more than you can ever imagine. </li>
          </ol> <ol start="18" type="1"><li>Put yourself in the shoes of a person who just lost their spouse to death. What would you want? Give it to them. Show up, Keep up and Shut up. That is, be there, keep in touch after everyone else leaves (say 2 months) and listen – talk only when necessary. </li>
