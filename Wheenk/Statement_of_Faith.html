          <p>Statement of Faith – Scott McOwen</p>
          <p>I believe in God who created not only the earth that we live on but the entire universe. I am able to communicate with Him because He sent His Son to earth in the form of a human named Jesus Christ to die for me along with the rest of humanity. This mysterious occurrence allowed Christ to take human nature into union with His Divine Person. Therefore, He is one God. He is Father. He is Son, and He is the Holy Spirit. Our created existence is because of God.</p>
          <p>I believe the reason I am able to communicate with God is that through Jesus Christ I have been given a gift, grace, but to receive it I must have faith to do so. Therefore, while grace is given to me, I must interact with it by faith. This understanding comes from my comprehension of Scripture. The Scripture is the first authority for my life of faith. Scripture is a collection of sacred books, committed to writing by men who were inspired by God. Scripture is also my authority for salvation. By discerning the truths in it I am able to live a life I believe is obedient to the way God desires. In focusing on this process of obedience to His will that I find in Scripture, I believe upon my earthly death that I will be able to live with God for eternity. </p>
          <p>I believe that if I do not give God proper respect and have as my first goal to glorify Him I might put something else before Him, therefore falling into sin of idolatry. If God created me and created the environment I exist in, it seems stupid on my part to not at least attempt to fit into His creation and do my best to honor Him. This is the reason I believe that I am to be a faithful steward of all God’s creation. What I have is not mine; God has loaned it to me. This is not just the physical things that I use but also the relationships that are in my life. My entire existence I owe to God therefore as I have a responsibility to glorify, respect, honor, and worship God as much as I am humanly possible.</p>
          <p>I believe that not only I will be with God for eternity but that He has elected me to be with Him for eternity. I believe that He has made a commitment with “His church” which is the same that He has made with me. That is, if His church glorifies Him then its members will be with Him for eternity. </p>
          <p>I believe in the sacraments of baptism. The act of baptism not only states to the entire church that the one being baptized is making a public statement but also that there is a seal of the covenant of grace that occurs between the person being baptized and Christ.</p>
          <p>I believe in the sacrament of the Lord’s Supper. Again the Lord’s Supper is not only for the public statement that one is a follower of Christ, but by partaking in the act of communion a bond occurs with His mystical body of believers.</p>
          <p>I believe in non-ceasing and continuous prayer. I tend to do it more when I am in emotional and tough situations. I believe that I need His direction and I own everything to Him. Therefore He is owed my most humble gratitude and thanks. </p>
