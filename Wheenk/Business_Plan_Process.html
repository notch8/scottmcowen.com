          Business Plan Process<br />
          <br />
          Business Plan <br />
          <br />
          Models are a technique to help with the visualization of ideas. The business plan works as a model. You get to see your ideas in writing and so do others.<br />
          <br />
          We are going to get to a five-step business plan:<br />
          <br />
          VisionWhat are you building?<br />
          <br />
          Mission Why does this business exist?<br />
          <br />
          Objectives What will you measure?<br />
          <br />
          StrategiesHow will this business be built?<br />
          <br />
          PlansWhat is the work to be done?<br />
          <br />
          If you can fill these in without going further – do so - but if not proceed.<br />
          <br />
          In order to fill in each of the steps we are going to apply five processes to each step:<br />
          <br />
          Brainstorming generate new ideas by considering provocative questions<br />
          Researchgather information from external sources<br />
          Focusingprocess of prioritizing ideas and concepts<br />
          Summarizingcondensing, final prioritizing, editing<br />
          Feedbacksolicit objective feedback from trusted advisors<br />
          <br />
          There is no right, wrong, or perfect business plan. Your business will always be evolving and changing. So will your plan. Keep it simple and fun.<br />
          <br />
          Vision<br />
          The Vision Statement – What are you building?<br />
          The vision statement should describe your idea in a manner that captures the passion of the idea. The vision statement should stimulate thinking, communicate passion, and paint a very graphic picture of the business you want. You can hardly exaggerate your vision statement. Go ahead and write a wildly optimistic, no limits, maybe even outrageous, vision statement. This is your opportunity to describe your dream. The key to capturing your vision is to be free flowing and not to restrict the flow of any thoughts. Capture all thoughts that come to your mind and use powerful adjectives to describe all the characteristics. Be sure to include the personal elements of your vision, as this is the source of your passion that will carry you through the difficult and frustrating times. Describe your vision as you see it now!<br />
          <br />
          <br />
          <br />
          Brainstorm Exercise<br />
          Your Vision … Creating the company you want.<br />
          What? Products or services: or both? How many? Company Image: What will this company be known for? Owner’s Role: What is your role? How will you spend your time?<br />
          Where? Business: Local, regional, national or international? Customers: Where are they? What cities, states, countries? Business Operations: Headquarters, sales offices, manufacturing, etc.?<br />
          Who? Customers: Who are they? (Most businesses have several types of customers) Strategic Alliances: Who can you partner with? Advisors: Who can provide professional and strategic advice and help you grow this business properly?<br />
          When? Start-up: When will this business be operational? Facilities: When will office/manufacturing/distribution space be required? Systems: When must they be selected, tested, and operational?<br />
          Why? Owner: Why am I creating this business? Customers: Why will they buy these products or services? Investor/Bankers: Why will they invest/loan money to this business?<br />
          How? Financing: How will this business be finances? Culture: How do you want to interact with employees, suppliers, customers: Personal Beliefs: How will your personal beliefs about business impact this business?<br />
          <br />
          Interview Exercise<br />
          What’s the product or service? <br />
          Describe three characteristics of your product or service: <br />
          Describe three things you product or service won’t do:<br />
          Who’s the customer?<br />
          Describe three characteristics of your best current or potential customers or clients:<br />
          Describe three characteristics of clients or customers you would be better off not serving:<br />
          What’s the business environment?<br />
          Describe three characteristics of successful businesses you admire and would like to emulate:<br />
          Describe three characteristics of businesses you would not like to emulate:<br />
          Focus Exercise<br />
          Step 1. Vision Statement (First Draft)<br />
          Within the next_____years, grow__________(company name) into a $_________(annual sales___________________(type or description of business) providing _________________(description of products and/or services to____________(describe your customers.<br />
          Step 2. Rewrite the vision statement above, modifying it using your own words:<br />
          Step 3. Write a wildly optimistic, no limits, outrageous vision statement!<br />
          An example: Create a network of Cafes around the world that are live and cyberspace networking salons featuring educational entertainment and electronic cyber theater. It will be a fun place where people gather for play and work; where creative people, using the marriage of art and technology learn from each other and have a forum for showcasing their work.<br />
          <br />
          Feedback Exercise<br />
          Take a few days to reflect on the three vision statements you wrote. Then share them with a couple of friends or associates. Write the feedback from two people noting key words and phrases from the above sources and other places you would like to use in your own vision statement. Rewrite your vision statement two times. Use your own style to describe your vision and choose words that are comfortable and meaningful to you. Do not use many words. Now write this vision statement on a blank page.<br />
          <br />
          Mission<br />
          The Mission Statement: Why does this business exist?<br />
          The mission statement describes the purpose for which your product, service, or business exists. They always answer the question, “Why will customers buy this product or service?” Your initial mission statement is likely to be multiple sentences, but try to keep in concise and powerful. Mission statements are also about commitments and promises. Ask yourself, What is your company committed to providing your customers? Mission statements must reflect the owner’s passion and commitment.<br />
          Brainstorm Exercise<br />
          Your Mission… What’s in it for the customer and you?<br />
          Step 1. What is the product or service? What differentiates you from the competition?<br />
          Step 2. Describe your ideal customers.<br />
          Step 3. Why will customers buy this product or service? What value does this product or service provide the customer? What unique benefits does this product or service provide the customer?<br />
          Step 4. What passions are you trying to satisfy by building the business? What beliefs do you have about business that will impact this business? What is the highest good that this business can achieve? What values will drive this business? Who will benefit from this business?<br />
          Interview Exercise<br />
          Restate the answers to the following questions:<br />
          Why will customers buy your company’s product or service?<br />
          What is your company committed to providing your customers?<br />
          What can your company promise?<br />
          What passions are you trying to satisfy by building this business?<br />
          Focus Exercise<br />
          Experiment with 1-6 key words that describe why your company exists from your customer’s point of view. Capture your competitive marketing edge or unique selling proposition. Do this two times. Does this mission support your vision?<br />
          An example of a high tech employment search company: “We find the right employees to make your business successful.”<br />
          Feedback Exercise<br />
          Refine your mission statement and try it on two people and have them give you input. Now write it out and rewrite it below your vision statement on the blank paper.<br />
          <br />
          Objectives<br />
          The Objectives: What results will you measure?<br />
          Objectives clarify what it is you are trying to accomplish in specific, measurable goals. For an objective to be effective, it needs to be a well-defined target with quantifiable elements that are measurable. Whereas your vision statement is expansive and idealistic, and the mission statement short, powerful, memorable, and customer oriented, your objectives are designed to focus your resources on achieving specific results. The purpose of a well-defined objective is to cause meaningful action. Meaningful specifics are those individuals who know what they want to achieve in very specific terms and have targets and time frames written down to help them get there. Become a “meaningful specific” not a “wandering generality”. There are many types of objectives and your plan should include a wide variety. For many businesses the two most important categories will be the financial and marketing objectives. It is important, however, to tailor your objectives to cover the entire scope of your business, focusing on the goals that are most critical to your success. If you have an objective for revenue, profitability, two or three for marketing, that leaves four or five to cover manufacturing, operations, personnel, and other important goals that are critical to your success. Keep your objectives meaningful by making them specific and important. Create objectives that can be measured and then measure the results throughout the year. Objectives are a prime tool for accountability. Stay focused and stay on track!<br />
          Brainstorm Exercise – What accomplishments would you like to celebrate?<br />
          This year….next year…<br />
          Imagine what you might say at the company celebration dinner: Congratulations: We successfully completed (______). We are proud to announce the beginning of (_____). We no longer have to deal with (_____) because we (_____). We increased (_____) by (_____). We decreased (_____) by (_____). <br />
          Where does success come from? What will it look like?<br />
          Step 1. Where have you been successful in the past? How can you expand upon these successes?<br />
          Step 2. What were your past mistakes? What have you learned from these mistakes&gt;?<br />
          Step 3. What ideas have you not acted on? Which of these ideas will you go forward with?<br />
          Focus Exercise<br />
          What targets will you aim for?<br />
          1.Financial- sales – profit – gross margin – cash flow – inventory – owner compensation – debt – etc. Example, Increase profit margin 30%.<br />
          2.Marketing and Sales – revenue – units sold - # of accounts - # of new customers - # of repeat customers – advertising response rates – sales per employee – closing rate – etc. Example, Improve sales per employee to $1M per year.<br />
          3.Operations – job count – units processed per hour – service time – shipping time – error rates – equipment downtime – etc. Example, Reduce customer service labor costs per order by 5% by X date.<br />
          4.Human Resources – compensation – benefits – safety – morale – environment – overtime – use of contractors – training hours – employee turnover rate – etc. Example, Reduce overtime to 8% or less by X date.<br />
          5.R &amp; D - # of projects completed - # of successful test – documentation rates – safety incidents – environmental emissions – design productivity – cost reduction – etc. Example, Complete 11 projects by X date.<br />
          6.Manufacturing – production units/cost – capacity – quality – dual sources% - scrap rates – labor efficiency – downtime – inventory levels – etc. Example, Produce X number of units by X date.<br />
          7.Personal - # of vacation days taken - # of hours worked per week – take home pay – retirement – education – personal growth – charitable contributions – public speaking – etc. Example, Increase vacation to 3 weeks.<br />
          8.Other – professional awards – investors return – banker covenants – supplier reliability – government headaches – community activities Examples, Donate 100 hours of volunteer time per quarter.<br />
          What does this business need to accomplish?<br />
          Describe the activity required: What will happen and when? What is the financial impact? Do this for four objectives. Example Develop/introduce new products. A book by X date, Sales of X by X date.<br />
          Crafting Meaningful Objectives.<br />
          Now rewrite the objectives into sentences or phrases combing your responses in the four columns. Example, Introduce a book by X date and an audio type by X date, resulting in sales of X for the year of X.<br />
          Examples of objectives that work and what doesn’t. Increases sales 20% to X million in X year. Works. It is specific, and measurable. Develop a sustainable business; minimize peaks and valleys. Not specific. It does not work.<br />
          Summarize: Read your vision and mission statements and rewrite your objectives below. Ask yourself again if these objectives will accomplish your vision and mission statements. Now write your objectives once more on the blank page under the mission statement.<br />
          <br />
          Strategies<br />
          The Strategies – How will you grow this business?<br />
          Strategies set the direction, philosophy, values, and methodology for building and managing your company. Strategies also establish guidelines and boundaries for evaluation important business decisions. Following a predefined set of strategies in critical to keeping a business on track. One way of understanding strategies is to think of them as “industry practices.” Strategies are not secret. In fact they are common knowledge and openly shared in every industry. Pick up an industry publication and you will know precisely what the industry’s leaders have to say about the opportunities and how to capitalize on them. These leaders will also share their current problems and their solutions. In most industries there are four to six core strategies that the successful businesses follow. These core strategies are easy to understand, remain relatively constant over time, are used by market leaders, and result in growth and profitability. A properly constructed set of strategies will define your business and keep it focused. For example, a CPA whose vision is to build a local practice would be significantly off track to accept international clients who would take him out of the country on extended trips. An upscale boutique targeting high-income clientele would not be wise to locate right next door to a K-Mart. Strategies must address both internal and external influences that are affecting or may affect your business. Strategies provide the answer to the question: “What will make this business successful over time?”<br />
          Brainstorm Exercise – Key Elements to Building Your Business.<br />

          3.What threats exist?<br />
          4.How can we minimize the threats or turn the threats into opportunities?<br />
          Examples of Industry Issues – pricing – customers – suppliers – cost reduction – environment – market – competition – government – economic – technology – media – the public – taxes – import/export regulations – etc.<br />
          Focus Exercise<br />

          What doesn’t work well?<br />
          How do we solve the problems?<br />
          Focus Exercise<br />
          Select three critical issues that are limiting your company’s growth, profitability, or effectiveness. This exercise helps you differentiate between symptoms and root causes so that you can see more clearly what needs to happen to achieve a permanent and effective change. (For established businesses only)<br />
          List 3 issues or symptoms:<br />
          What is the root cause of this?<br />
          What needs to change?<br />
          How will results be measured?<br />
          Focus Exercise – How do we get from here to there?<br />

          Focus Exercise<br />
          Crafting Meaningful Strategies<br />
          From the focus exercise above select up to five areas that are critical to building your company. Draft a strategy statement for each one below. <br />
          Do these strategies describe:<br />
          How the business will be built and managed?<br />
          How we will capitalize on market opportunities?<br />
          How we will solve our business’s critical problems?<br />
          Examples of Strategies – What works – Position company for strategic acquisition in 2006; build brands, identity, management team, and profits. Sets the direction with the big picture and exit strategy. What doesn’t work is: Make money, limit investment in business and employees, think about retirement at age 65. Everything is wrong with this strategy. <br />
          Summarize<br />
          Use this summary to refine your strategies by writing them down. Check each strategy for the following characteristics: easy to understand, constant over time, used by market leaders, and results in growth and profitability. Now rewrite it on the blank page.<br />
          <br />
          Plan<br />
          The Plans – What is the work to be done?<br />
          Plans are the specific actions the business must implement to achieve the objectives. Plan or action items should be important, significant, and contribute to the growth of your business. Each plan or action item is, in effect, a project. Ideally, each plan statement should directly relate to an objective and a strategy. Plans should be action oriented, should specify specific tasks, and should have deadlines. If your business has employees, independent contractors, or utilizes outside resources to complete tasks, the ideal plan statement will identify who is responsible for performing each function. The exercises in this section are designed to guide you in the development and prioritization of your action plans and in relating them to specific objectives and or strategies. In preparing your plans, estimate the cost and time frame for each project. Transfer this information into your budget work sheets, calculate the impact of your to-do list on your cash follow. If you don’t know what your projects will cost, it’s quite likely you will not have enough cash to fund them. A project with no cash is like a car with no gas – it’s not going very far. Make your plans carefully. Execute them on time, within budge, and with excellence. Measure their impact routinely.<br />
          Brainstorm Exercise – Business – Building Projects<br />
          List six projects that would make a big difference in your business. Tie them to an objective or a strategy. Then answer the three questions for each project. <br />
          1.What impact would completing the project have?<br />
          2.How will you measure the results?<br />
          3.What are the next three steps?<br />
          4.Integrating Objectives, Strategies, and Plans<br />
          Choose five projects form the preceding projects and complete the chart below for each.<br />
          Objective or strategy + Project to be completed + Person Responsible + Completion Date<br />
          Focus Exercise – Crafting Meaningful Plans<br />
          Now rewrite the above plans into sentences or phrases, combining your responses in the four parts. Example: Hire route salesman for territory in fourth quarter. It is a specific position; some leeway for completion. Do no say, “Hire approximately six new employees.”<br />
          Summarize<br />
          Use this summary to refine your plans by writing them down. Now write your plans on the first page under the list of the others. <br />
          Keep the plan with you.<br />
          Update it with new thoughts.<br />
          Share it with people you trust and whose opinions you value.<br />
          Measure your progress at least quarterly.<br />
          Prepare a budget to match the plan. (Sales, gross profit, expenses and net income) (Use these categories to put together the following scenarios – Good – OK – Bad – in order to be ready for whatever comes your financial way.)<br />
